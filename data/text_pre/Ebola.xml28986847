Future Approaches to DNA Vaccination Against Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses.
To date, there is no protective vaccine for Ebola virus infection. Safety concerns have prevented the use of live-attenuated vaccines, and forced researchers to examine new vaccine formulations. DNA vaccination is an attractive method for inducing protective immunity to a variety of pathogens, but the low immunogenicity seen in larger animals and humans has hindered its usage. Various approaches have been used to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines, but the most successful, and widespread, is electroporation. Of increasing interest is the use of molecular adjuvants to produce immunomodulatory signals that can both amplify and direct the immune response. When combined, these approaches have the possibility to push DNA vaccination into the forefront of medicine.
