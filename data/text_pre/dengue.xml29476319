Hypericum japonicum: a Double-Headed Sword to Combat Vector Control and Cancer.
Mosquito control with naturally derived herbal insecticides has gained much momentum, with the increased insecticide resistance of vectors and the multiple infectious diseases spread by them. Yet, recent studies also suggest that mosquitoes could probably transmit some cancerous cells or cancer-causing viruses from one individual to another between their blood meals. The current research thus focused on the screening and characterization of novel plants with both mosquitocidal and anticancerous properties. Accordingly, different solvent extracts of Hypericum japonicum, a key plant in Chinese medicine, were screened for its larvicidal efficacy using the fourth instar larvae of Aedes aegypti (major vector of Dengue and chikungunya). Methanolic extracts of the plant showed effective larvicidal property with LC  7.37 ppm and LC 11.59 ppm values. The anticancerous property of the plant extract was also evaluated by in vitro cytotoxicity assay against Daltons Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) cells. The results indicated that H. japonicum plant extracts at very low concentrations of LC 0.95 ppm and LC 1.85 ppm were potent cytotoxic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and the foremost report of Hypericum japonicum as a potent mosquitocidal and anticancerous agent. Identification and characterization of such plant-derived bioactive plants thus could serve as a double-headed sword against the spread of infectious diseases and cancer.
