Elevated cardiac biomarkers and echocardiographic left ventricular dysfunction at admission in patients with dengue fever: report from a tertiary care center in Northwest India.
Cardiac involvement is not an uncommon manifestation in dengue fever and diagnosing it has always been a challenge to physicians owing to its constellation of clinical features and lack of standard screening methods. We studied the prevalence of cardiac involvement among fifty sequential adult patients of dengue fever admitted in our emergency department, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India, who were assessed clinically and classified based on the severity. They were studied for possible cardiac involvement by means of point-of-care testing for serum cardiac biomarkers (quantitative troponin-I, creatinine kinase - MB Isoform and cardiac myoglobin) and two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram (2D-echo). Evidence of myocardial involvement was present in 16% and 30% patients based on 2D-echo and biomarker testing respectively. On univariate analysis, the presence of cardiac symptoms (p = 0.009) and of shock (p = 0.003) showed statistically significant association with biomarker elevation. However, this and evidence of myocardial dysfunction by 2-D echo showed poor inter-correlation.
