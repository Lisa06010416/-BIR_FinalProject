C5a receptor targeting of partial non-structural protein 3 of dengue virus promotes antigen-specific IFN-γ-producing T-cell responses in a mucosal dengue vaccine model.
Mucosal vaccination is an ideal strategy to induce protective immunity in both mucosal and parenteral areas. Successful induction of an antigen-specific immune response via mucosal administration essentially requires the effective delivery of antigen into a mucosal immune inductive site, which depends on antigen delivery into M cells. We previously reported that M cells specifically express C5aR, and antigen targeting to C5aR by using specific ligands, including Co1 peptide, promotes the antigen-specific immune response in both mucosal and systemic immune compartments. In this study, we found that application of the Co1 peptide to dengue virus antigen containing CD8 T cell epitopes effectively induced an antigen-specific IFN-γ-producing CD8  T cell response after oral mucosal administration of antigen. Consequently, we suggest that Co1 peptide-mediated C5aR targeting of antigen into M cells can be used for the induction of an effective antigen-specific CD8  T cell immune response in oral mucosal vaccine development.
