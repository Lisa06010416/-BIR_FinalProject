Dengue virus infections among blood donors in Guangxi of China, 2013-2014.
An unexpected, large dengue outbreak, spreading to 20 cities of Guangdong province, occurred in July 2014. Considering the overwhelming influence of this seasonal epidemic, whether this dengue virus outbreak has an significant impact on the blood donors of the ajacent areas in Guangdong requires at least a preliminary investigation. Liuzhou City of Guangxi was chosen as a good representative of the neighbouring geographical location of the dengue virus (DENV) outbreak areas in this research. We therefore investigated qualified blood donations during potential dengue epidemic seasons and thus provided critical information for public health and donation policy making.A total of 1685 donations from 2013 to 2014 were collected at the Guangxi blood centre. Anti-DENV testing was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dengue IgG indirect ELISA and Dengue IgM capture ELISA were used to detect anti-DENV IgM and IgG. Repeat-reactive samples with ELISA test and 1685 donations with 421 pools were screened for dengue RNA by reverse transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) using an in-house assay.There was a total of 13 seropositive donors, including 6 IgM seropositive and 7 IgG seropositive. The total seropositive rate was 0·78%, with IgM 0·36% and IgG 0·42%. Seropositive donors were identified mostly between April and November, with a peak in November. .All samples in reactive pools and individual seropositive samples were negative in the follow-up RT-PCR test.Our results suggested that the Guangdong dengue outbreak had limited impact on blood safety in surrounding areas under our current testing system.
