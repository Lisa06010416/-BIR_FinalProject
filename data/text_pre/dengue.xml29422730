Acute Renal Failure Adversely Affects Survival in Pediatric Dengue Infection.
Dengue is currently one of the most important mosquito-borne viral infections. Acute renal failure (ARF) is a serious complication among children suffering from dengue infection.A retrospective cohort review of baseline characteristics, disease outcomes, and risk factors of dengue-infected patients, with and without renal failure (RF), were compared.Among 97 children with dengue, 13.4% had RF (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m ) at presentation. In comparison to all children (100%) of RF cohort, only 32% children of non-RF cohort (DHF/DSS is an independent risk factor for the development of ARF in patients with dengue infection. Mortality rate is high once RF develops in these children.
