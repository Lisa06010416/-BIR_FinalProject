Economic cost and burden of dengue during epidemics and non-epidemic years in Taiwan.
Determining the disease and economic burden of dengue is critical for the allocation of public health resources. Several studies have used disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) to estimate the disease burden of dengue in different regions. However, there are no published studies discussing the estimates of dengue-related economic and disease burden specifically in Taiwan.We assessed the economic cost and disease burden of dengue infections in Taiwan for the period 1998-2014, and compared these during epidemic and non-epidemic years.We estimated the annual DALYs per million population using the disability weights for dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS), and death cases. Economic costs were estimated and divided into direct (medical costs) and indirect costs (lost work days and caregiver fees).For the period 1998-2014, a mean of 115.3 (range: 6.3-934.3) DALYs per million population annually were lost to dengue. In epidemic years, direct costs associated with dengue resulted mostly from hospitalization (86.09%), emergency (7.77%), outpatient (6.10%), and drug costs (0.03%). For indirect costs, lost productivity due to death (70.76%) was the dominant contributor. Overall, the costs were 12.3 times higher in epidemic years than in non-epidemic years (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p<0.05).This study is the first to evaluate the economic costs and disease burden of dengue infections for this period in Taiwan, and reveals significant differences in economic impact between epidemic and non-epidemic years.
