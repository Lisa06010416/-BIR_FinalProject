Arboviruses: A Family on the Move.
Arboviruses are a diverse group of vector-borne viruses, many of whose members are the cause of significant human morbidity and mortality. Over the last 30Â years, the emergence and/or resurgence of arboviruses have posed a considerable global health threat. The ongoing geographical expansion of the dengue viruses (DENV), along with the explosive outbreaks of West Nile virus (WNV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and more recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) have all served as reminders that new epidemics may emerge at any time from this diversity. A clearer understanding of what mechanisms drive these dramatic changes in vector-host transmission cycles that result in the human population becoming significantly more exposed, will help to prepare us for the next emerging epidemic/pandemic. This Chapter seeks to provide a brief overview of the arboviruses, their mode of transmission and some of the known factors that drive their expansion.
