Sensitive Multiplex Real-time RT-qPCR Assay for the Detection of Filoviruses.
Filoviruses are important etiological agents of emergent diseases with high mortality rates. Traditionally, filovirus fever diseases have primarily been a burden of African countries; however, global interconnectedness has increased the probability of the worldwide spread of filoviruses. Therefore, national healthcare organizations need tools for managing filovirus risk, including diagnostic kits based on real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), as this is the most suitable method for diagnosing filovirus fever diseases. Here we describe a real-time RT-qPCR assay for filovirus detection. This assay is a further development of our previously reported EBOV (Zaire)-Fl kit. Two sets (FiloA-Fl and FiloB-Fl) of real-time RT-qPCR assays for the detection of filoviruses were developed and evaluated using armored RNA phage particles (ARs) as positive controls. The limit of detection of the assay was 5x10  copies/ml of the AR-positive control for the FiloA-Fl set and 5x10  copies/ml of the AR-positive control for the FiloB-Fl set. Our assay provides a rapid and sensitive tool for detecting filoviruses. The high specificity and sensitivity of the assay make it useful for clinical and epidemiologic investigations in the field of filovirus fever diseases and their etiological agents.
