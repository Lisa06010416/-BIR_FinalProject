Use of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis in integrated vector control of Aedes sp. in Sri Lanka: a prospective controlled effectiveness study.
The annual incidence of dengue has been increasing over the last few years in Sri Lanka with seasonal epidemics. Biological control of the vector has not been part of the integrated vector control implemented by the public health authorities of Sri Lanka so far. This pilot study assessed the effectiveness of using Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) spray to control the Aedes mosquito vector population density.Prospective controlled effectiveness study in three administrative divisions of Colombo. Study areas were selected from urban, semiurban and rural administrative divisions within the district, and they were compared with two matching controls from the same division. Test areas received three cycles of Bti spraying 1 month apart. Control areas were not sprayed with Bti. Ovitrap and larval indices were calculated at baseline and 2 weeks after each spray cycle.There was a significant improvement in the adult vector population (ovitrap index) in the test areas after three spray cycles, but this effect had disappeared after 8 weeks (no residual effect). There was no consistent positive impact on larval indices (premise, container and Breteau indices) after each spray cycle.Bti might have a moderate impact on adult vector populations mediated via transient reductions in larval populations. However, this effect is not sustained probably due to rapid re-infestation. Bti spray, if implemented, can only play a supplementary role to other vector control methods.
