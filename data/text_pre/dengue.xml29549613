Climate variability and dengue hemorrhagic fever in Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia.
To determine the association of climatic factors and dengue hemorrhagic fever and to develop the prediction approach of future dengue transmission. The study used totally monthly dengue hemorrhagic fever cases at Health Office Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. Monthly meteorological data, consisting of temperature, rainfall, and humidity, was obtained from the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency in Kendari district. All data analysis, including Spearman and Poisson distribution, was carried out in R Studio (version 3.3.2) utilizing the R statistical language version 2.15. The highest rate of dengue hemorrhagic fever cases was found in January, February, and March. Temperature averages at lag 2 (p = 0.53, p < 0.0001), lag 3 (p = 0.59, p < 0.0001), and lag 4 (p = 0.41, p < 0.01)) correlated with the incident rate of DHF. The average temperature at lag 2 was found to have a positive impact on the incidence of DHF by Poisson function. This study provides preliminary evidence of the influence of climatic factors on dengue transmission.
