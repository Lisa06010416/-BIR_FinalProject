Role of Cytokines as Molecular Marker of Dengue Severity.
Dengue infection is a rapidly spreading vector-borne disease and is endemic in the Indian subcontinent. It has varied manifestations ranging from subclinical infection to severe fatal shock syndrome. This study aimed to estimate cytokine level in dengue patients and correlate them with dengue severity.Cases of dengue fever diagnosed in the department of medicine of our institute from July 2015 to November 2016 were included in the study. The clinical features, biochemical, hematological and radiological parameters along with cytokine levels (Interferon-gamma, Interleukin-6, and Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha) were recorded in all patients.Out of 80 confirmed cases of dengue included in the study, 50 had nonsevere dengue (Group 1), and 30 patients had severe dengue (Group 2). The median level of serum TNF-Î± in group 2 (62.5 pg/mL) was significantly higher than the median level in group 1 (20 pg/mL), (Some cytokines may play a role in the pathogenesis of severe manifestations of dengue.
