Liver involvement in dengue viral infections.
Dengue fever is the commonest viral haemorrhagic fever worldwide and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the tropics. Dengue viral infections are frequently associated with varying degrees of liver injury. Liver injury is more severe in dengue haemorrhagic fever or severe dengue. We review the current knowledge on liver involvement following dengue viral infections and explore the links between clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and their impact on management.
