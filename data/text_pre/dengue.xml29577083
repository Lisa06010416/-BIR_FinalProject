Human Antibody Responses to Emerging Mayaro Virus and Cocirculating Alphavirus Infections Examined by Using Structural Proteins from Nine New and Old World Lineages.
Mayaro virus (MAYV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are vector-borne alphaviruses that cocirculate in South America. Human infections by these viruses are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, especially in areas with high dengue virus endemicity. Disease may progress to debilitating arthralgia (MAYV, CHIKV), encephalitis (VEEV), and death. Few standardized serological assays exist for specific human alphavirus infection detection, and antigen cross-reactivity can be problematic. Therefore, serological platforms that aid in the specific detection of multiple alphavirus infections will greatly expand disease surveillance for these emerging infections. In this study, serum samples from South American patients with PCR- and/or isolation-confirmed infections caused by MAYV, VEEV, and CHIKV were examined by using a protein microarray assembled with recombinant capsid, envelope protein 1 (E1), and E2 from nine New and Old World alphaviruses. Notably, specific antibody recognition of E1 was observed only with MAYV infections, whereas E2 was specifically targeted by antibodies from all of the alphavirus infections investigated, with evidence of cross-reactivity to E2 of o'nyong-nyong virus only in CHIKV-infected patient serum samples. Our findings suggest that alphavirus structural protein microarrays can distinguish infections caused by MAYV, VEEV, and CHIKV and that this multiplexed serological platform could be useful for high-throughput disease surveillance.
