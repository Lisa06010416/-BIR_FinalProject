Pathogen-insect interaction candidate molecules for transmission-blocking control strategies of vector borne diseases.
To analyze the current knowledge of pathogen-insect interactions amenable for the design of molecular-based control strategies of vector-borne diseases.We examined malaria, dengue, and Chagas disease pathogens and insect molecules that participate in interactions during their vectors infection.Pathogen molecules that participate in the insect intestine invasion and induced vector immune molecules are presented, and their inclusion in transmission blocking vaccines (TBV) and in genetically modify insect (GMI) vectors or symbiotic bacteria are discussed.Disruption of processes by blocking vector-pathogen interactions provides several candidates for molecular control strategies, but TBV and GMI efficacies are still limited and other secondary effects of GMI (improving transmission of other pathogens, affectation of other organisms) should be discarded.
