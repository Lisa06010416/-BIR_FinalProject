Frequency and intensity of pyrethroid resistance through the CDC bottle bioassay and their association with the frequency of kdr mutations in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) from Mexico.
The control of Aedes aegypti (L.), the main urban vector that causes arboviral diseases such as dengue, Chikungunya and Zika, has proved to be a challenge because of a rapid increase in insecticide resistance. Therefore, adequate monitoring of insecticide resistance is an essential element in the control of Ae. aegypti and the diseases it transmits. We estimated the frequency and intensity (Resistance Frequency Rapid Diagnostic Test [F-RDT] and Resistance Intensity Rapid Diagnostic Test [I-RDT]) of pyrethroid resistance in populations of Ae. aegypti from Mexico using the bottle bioassay and results were related to the frequencies of knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations V1016I and F1534C.All populations under study were resistant to the pyrethroids: bifenthrin (99%), d-(cis-trans)-phenothrin (6.3% cis, 91.7% trans) and permethrin (99.5%) according to F-RDT, and showed moderate to high-intensity resistance at 10× the diagnostic dose (DD) in I-RDT. Frequencies of the kdr mutation V1016I in Ae. aegypti populations were correlated with moderate permethrin resistance at 10× DD, whereas F1534C mutation frequencies were correlated with high bifenthrin resistance at 5× DD. Both I1016 and C1535 were highly correlated with high-intensity phenothrin resistance at 1× to 10× DD.This study showed that high frequencies of kdr mutations V1016I and F1534C are reflected in the results of F-RDT and I-RDT tests. Bioassays in conjunction with the characterization of genetic resistance mechanisms are indispensable in the strategic and rational management of resistance in mosquitoes. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.
