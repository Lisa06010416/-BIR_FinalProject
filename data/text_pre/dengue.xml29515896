Effects of complexity and seasonality on backward bifurcation in vector-host models.
We study implications of complexity and seasonality in vector-host epidemiological models exhibiting backward bifurcation. Vector-host diseases represent complex infection systems that can vary in the transmission processes and population stages involved in disease progression. Seasonal fluctuations in external forcing factors can also interact in a complex way with internal host factors to govern the transmission dynamics. In backward bifurcation, the insufficiency of
