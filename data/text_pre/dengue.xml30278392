Microcystin and pyriproxyfen are toxic to early stages of development in Rhamdia quelen: An experimental and modelling study.
The recent increase of freshwater eutrophication has favored cyanobacteria blooms and consequently the increase of toxins such as microcystin-LR in aquatic environments, but few is know about the associated effect of toxin and other compounds. Pyriproxyfen is an insecticide indicated by WHO (World Health Organization) to control Aedes aegypti mosquito (vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika diseases), however, the effects are not well described to non-target species, such as fish. The early life stages (ELS) of fish are more sensitive to chemical stress due to higher metabolic rate, immature immune system and high superficial area/volume ratio. In the current study, ELS of R. quelen a Neotropical fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of microcystin (1, 10 and 100 µg L   M1, M2 and M3 groups, respectively) from an algal extract, pyriproxyfen (1 and 10 µg L , P1 and P2) and their association (co-exposure). The hatching, survival and larvae deformities were analyzed, and applied a mathematical model to evaluate the effects on the population size along further generations. Both compounds were toxic to embryos/larvae of fish, but the effects were more pronounced in M2, P1M2 and P2M1 for hatching and M2, P1M2, P2M1 and P1 for survival. Deformities prevailed in groups exposed to the chemicals at 48 hpf (hours post-fertilization) were suggestions of toxicological interaction in P1M2, P2M1 and P2M2 at 48 and 72 hpf. In 96 hpf, the levels of deformities were lower than in previous times. Model predicted population density over 100 years decreased to lower than 0.5 (50%) in all groups, except for P1M1, indicating risk of extinction. P1M2 had the worse results, followed by M2, P1M3 and P2M1. Cyanobacterial blooms can lead to microcystin-LR levels higher than M2 (10 µg L ), and the suggestion of toxicological interaction with pyriproxyfen is relevant because both compounds may potentially coexist in aquatic environments. Finally, mathematical models may provide an ecological interpretation of the risk of exposure of fish.
