Male contributions during mating increase female survival in the disease vector mosquito Aedes aegypti.
Aedes aegypti is a vector of medically important viruses including those causing Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. During mating, males transfer a number of proteins and other molecules to the female and these components of the male ejaculate are essential in shifting female post-mating behaviors in a number of insect species. Because these molecules are highly variable by species, and female post-mating behavior by species is also varied, behavioral assays testing the function of the ejaculate are necessary before we can develop control strategies targeting the mating system to reduce mosquito populations. Because increased survival in mosquitoes strongly increases vectorial capacity and can influence population sizes and potential risk we tested the effect of mating on female survival. The ejaculate can either promote or reduce female survival, as both have been shown in multiple insect species, yet this effect has not been directly assessed in mosquitoes. We compared survival of females in four treatment groups: mated females, virgin females, and virgin females injected with either an extract from the male reproductive glands or a saline control. Survival, blood feeding frequency, fecundity and cumulative net reproductive rate (R ) were determined after multiple feedings from a human host. Our results confirm that male reproductive gland substances increase female fecundity and blood feeding frequency, resulting in dramatic increases in fitness (R ). We also demonstrate, for the first time, an effect of male reproductive gland extracts alone on female survival, regardless of whether or not the female ingested a vertebrate blood meal. Thus, the effects of MAG extract on survival are not secondary effects from altered blood feeding. Collectively, we demonstrate a direct role for Ae. aegypti male-derived molecules on increasing female fitness, reproductive success and, ultimately, transmission potential for vector borne pathogens.
