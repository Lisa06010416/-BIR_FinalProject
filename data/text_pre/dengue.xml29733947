Sphingolipid signaling modulates trans-endothelial cell permeability in dengue virus infected HMEC-1 cells.
Dengue has emerged as a major mosquito-borne disease in the tropics and subtropics. In severe dengue, enhanced microvascular endothelial permeability leads to plasma leakage. Direct dengue virus (DENV) infection in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) can enhance trans-endothelial leakage. Using a microarray-based analysis, we identified modulation of key endothelial cell signaling pathways in DENV-infected HMEC-1 cells. One among them was the sphingolipid pathway that regulates vascular barrier function. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) and S1PR5 showed significant up-regulation in the microarray data. In DENV-infected cells, the kinetics of S1PR2 transcript expression and enhanced in vitro trans-endothelial permeability showed a correlation. We also observed an internalization and cytoplasmic translocation of VE-Cadherin, a component of adherens junctions (AJ), upon infection indicating AJ disassembly. Further, inhibition of S1PR2 signaling by a specific pharmacological inhibitor prevented translocation of VE-Cadherin, thus helping AJ maintenance, and abrogated DENV-induced trans-endothelial leakage. Our results show that sphingolipid signaling, especially that involving S1PR2, plays a critical role in vascular leakage in dengue.
