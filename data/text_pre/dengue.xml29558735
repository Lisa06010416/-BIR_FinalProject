Synthesis of 3'-halo-5'-norcarbocyclic nucleoside phosphonates as potent anti-HIV agents.
The synthesis and the antiviral evaluation of 3'-halo (iodo and fluoro) 5'-norcarbocyclic nucleoside phosphonates is described. No antiviral activity was observed against Zika virus, Dengue virus 2, HSV-1, HSV-2 and Chikungunya virus. In contrast, some of the synthesized compounds are potent inhibitors of the replication of HIV-1, comparatively to (R)-PMPA, with no concomitant cytotoxicity.
