Secondary structure and membrane topology of dengue virus NS4A protein in micelles.
Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural (NS) 4A is a membrane protein essential for viral replication. The N-terminal region of NS4A contains several helices interacting with the cell membrane and the C-terminal region consists of three potential transmembrane regions. The secondary structure of the intact NS4A is not known as the previous structural studies were carried out on its fragments. In this study, we purified the full-length NS4A of DENV serotype 4 into dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. Solution NMR studies reveal that NS4A contains six helices in DPC micelles. The N-terminal three helices are amphipathic and interact with the membrane. The C-terminal three helices are embedded in micelles. Our results suggest that NS4A contains three transmembrane helices. Our studies provide for the first time structural information of the intact NS4A of DENV and will be useful for further understanding its role in viral replication.
