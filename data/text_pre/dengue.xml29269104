Dengue virus induced changes in Ca  homeostasis in human hepatic cells that favor the viral replicative cycle.
The role of Ca  during dengue virus (DENV) replication is unknown; thus, changes in Ca  homeostasis in DENV infected human hepatic HepG2 and Huh-7 cells were analyzed. Infected HepG2 cells, but not Huh-7 cells, showed a significant increase in plasma membrane permeability to Ca , while both cell lines showed marked reduced levels of Ca  stored in the endoplasmic reticulum. While the expression levels of STIM1 and ORAI1 showed no changes, STIM1 and ORAI1 were shown to co-localized in infected cells, indicating activation of the store-operated Ca  entry (SOCE) pathway. Finally, manipulation in the infected cells of the intra and extracellular Ca  levels by chelators (BAPTA-AM and EGTA), SOC inhibitor (SKF96365), IP3 Receptor antagonist (2APB) or increase of extracellular [Ca ], significantly reduced DENV yield, but not vesicular stomatitis virus yield, used as a control. These results show that DENV infection alters cell Ca  homeostasis and that such changes favor viral replication.
