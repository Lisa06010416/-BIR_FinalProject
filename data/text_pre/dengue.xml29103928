Surveillance of intensity level and geographical spreading of dengue outbreak among males and females in Punjab, Pakistan: A case study of 2011.
Dengue fever is viral disease which spreads due to the bite of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In recent years, it has affected around 40% population of the world. Its endemic flow has led to a large disease burden, in terms of human and financial resources.Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are normally used to develop epidemiological thematic maps. This study explores the patterns and hotspots, associated with the catastrophic outbreak of dengue, in Punjab, in 2011. The ArcView software was used to analyze the data reported by the district hospitals of Punjab. Twenty-one-thousand cases were reported from March to December 2011, with 300 causalities.This research reveals that from among the total 37 epidemiological weeks, the maximum impact was observed between weeks 22 and 27. The geographical flow and hotspots associated with dengue have been shown through thematic maps. A positive correlation between the risk for dengue and age was observed. The findings of this research can help health officials and decision-makers alert the public about future outbreaks and take preventive measures to considerably reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the disease.
