Animal Models for Dengue and Zika Vaccine Development.
The current status of animal models in the study of dengue and Zika are covered in this review. Mouse models deficient in IFN signaling are used to overcome the natural resistance of mice to non-encephalitic flaviviruses. Conditional IFNAR mice and non-human primates (NHP) are useful immuno-competent models. Sterile immunity after dengue vaccination is not observed in NHPs. Placental and fetal development in NHPs is similar to humans, facilitating studies on infection-mediated fetal impairment.
