Vectorial status of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus of La Réunion Island for Zika virus.
La Réunion Island has been the scene of unusually large epidemics of dengue and chikungunya viruses with Aedes albopictus as the sole vector. After experimental oral infection, Ae. albopictus from La Réunion Island can disseminate both dengue and chikungunya viruses but not the Asian genotype of Zika virus, suggesting a strong midgut barrier to dissemination. Autochthonous transmission of the Asian genotype of Zika virus is improbable on La Réunion Island.
