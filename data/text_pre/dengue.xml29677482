Allosteric ligands for the pharmacologically important Flavivirus target (NS5) from ZINC database based on pharmacophoric points, free energy calculations and dynamics correlation.
Dengue virus belongs to a group of human pathogens, which causes different diseases, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome in humans. It possesses RNA as a genetic material and is replicated with the aid of NS5 protein. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important domain of NS5 in the replication of that virus. The catalytic process activity of RdRp is making it an important target for antiviral chemical therapy. To date, No FDA drug has been approved and marketed for the treatment of diseases caused by Dengue virus. So, there is a dire need to advance an area of active antiviral inhibitors that is safe, less expensive and widely available. An experimentally validated complex of Dengue NS5 and compound 27 (6LS) were used as pharmacophoric input and hits were identified. We also used Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations alongside free energy and dynamics of the internal residues of the apo and holo systems to understand the binding mechanism. Our analysis resulted that the three inhibitors (ZINC72070002, ZINC6551486, and ZINC39588257) greatly affected the interior dynamics and residual signaling to dysfunction the replicative role of NS5. The interaction of these inhibitors caused the loss of the correlated motion of NS5 near to the N terminus and helped the stability of the binding complex. This investigation provided a methodological route to discover allosteric inhibitors against the epidemics of this Flaviviruses. Allosteric inhibitors are important and major assets in considering the development of the competitive and robust antiviral agents such as against Dengue viral infection.
