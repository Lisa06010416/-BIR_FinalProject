The correlation of TNF alpha levels with the lipid profile of dengue patients.
Immunological factors, such as cytokines, have been proposed as a cause of changes in the lipid profile of dengue patients. We studied whether serum lipid levels and serum TNF-α levels are associated in a group of dengue patients from an endemic region in the Northwest of Mexico. We found statistically important differences in the serum lipid profile and the TNF-α levels of dengue patients compared with the control group, were observed. However, TNF-α levels did not correlate with the lipid profile of dengue patients.
