Myelitis and cauda equina involvement following dengue fever. A case report and review of the literature.
Dengue fever (DF) is a common arbovirosis in tropical and subtropical countries and may be associated with a wide range of neurological complications. We describe a 41-year-old man who developed weakness in the right arm and lower limbs, paresthesia in the upper and lower limbs, and sphincter disturbance four weeks following DF. Examination disclosed a wheel-chair bound patient with urinary catheter, areflexia in the lower limbs, and a sensation level at T10. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse lesions with contrast-enhanced areas extending from the medullary-cervical junction to the conus medullaris and cauda equina. A review of the literature reveals that this is the first report of clinical and imaging signs of myeloradiculitis with cauda equina involvement following DF infection.
