Synergistic antiviral activity of Sofosbuvir and type-I interferons (α and β) against Zika virus.
Zika virus (ZIKV) is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes Dengue-like illness, neurological symptoms such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome and microcephaly in children born to infected pregnant mothers. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared ZIKV infection as a Global Health Emergency. However, there are no known prophylactic or therapeutic measures against this virus. As a proof of concept toward combination therapeutic strategy against ZIKV, combinations of host-targeted (Interferon-α and Interferon-β) and direct acting (Sofosbuvir) antivirals were evaluated in a hepatic cell line (Huh7) using a Cytoprotection (CP) assay. The combination of these antivirals resulted in synergistic inhibition of ZIKV infection in the in vitro CP assay. Additional testing in a ZIKV yield assay demonstrated that combination treatment of these antivirals conferred >2-log reduction in the release of viral RNA. Measurement of ZIKV proteins in the cells infected with multiple ZIKV strains isolated from different geographical regions (Americas, Asia, and Africa) using an immunofluorescence assay confirmed the effective antiviral activity of this combination against ZIKV. These results demonstrate the in vitro proof of concept (POC) for using a combination approach utilizing the strengths of both virus and host-targeted antivirals. These results suggest the effectiveness of the combination strategy in combating ZIKV, in the in vitro systems. Further evaluation of such combination therapies in vivo might provide an impetus for the development of effective ZIKV therapeutic strategies.
