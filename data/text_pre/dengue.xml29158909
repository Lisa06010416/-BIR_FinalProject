First complete genome sequence of circulating dengue virus serotype 3 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
Here we report the first full-length genome sequence of dengue virus serotype 3 (DENV-3) from a strain isolated from a patient in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2014. The genome consists of 10Â 635 bp and shows close similarity to circulating genotype III isolates from Singapore, suggesting possible importation, most probably during religious pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia.
