Antibodies Against Chikungunya in Northern Mozambique During Dengue Outbreak, 2014.
An outbreak of dengue and high densities of Aedes aegypti were reported in 2014 in northern Mozambique, suggesting an increased risk for other arboviruses such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in this region. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of CHIKV during an outbreak of dengue virus (DENV) in Pemba city in northern Mozambique in 2014. Febrile patients (n = 146) seeking medical attention at the Pemba Provincial Hospital between March and April 2014 were enrolled in this study. Blood samples from each participant were tested for chikungunya and DENV RNA, IgM and IgG antibodies using PCR and ELISA, respectively. The median age of the patients was 26 years (interquartile range: 20-34 years), and 52.7% (77/146) were female. We found that 7.0% (8/114) of the patients were positive for CHIKV IgM and 31.5% (46/146) presented with CHIKV IgG antibodies. DENV IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in 38.3% (46/120) and 28.2% (33/117) of the patients, respectively. This study is the first investigation regarding the occurrence of CHIKV in the north of Mozambique over the last 60 years and our data suggest that Mozambicans had been silently exposed to the virus in this part of the country, indicating that not only DENV but also CHIKV is an arbovirus to consider in febrile patients seeking medical attention in northern Mozambique.
