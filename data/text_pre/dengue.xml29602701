Delineating the serotype-specific neutralizing antibody response to a live attenuated tetravalent dengue vaccine.
The dengue virus (DENV) vaccines that are licensed or in clinical development consist of DENV serotype 1-4 tetravalent formulations given simultaneously and are not acquired sequentially like natural infections. It is unclear what effect this has on development of protective levels of immunity to all four serotypes. Serotype-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) is considered the most relevant correlate of protection from dengue disease. Here we assessed levels of serotype-specific and cross-reactive NAb in immune sera from 10 subjects vaccinated with a live attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccine developed at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. The majority of subjects NAb responses to DENV-2 and DENV-4 were type-specific, while their NAb responses to DENV-1 and DENV-3 were primarily cross-reactive. Vaccine virus RNAemia has been most frequently detected for DENV-2 and DENV-4 in vaccinated subjects, strongly suggesting that replication is important for eliciting serotype-specific immunity.
