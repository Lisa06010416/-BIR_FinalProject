Timely diagnosis, use of information technology and mosquito control prevents dengue outbreaks: Experience from central India.
Dengue is most important arboviral disease spreading to newer areas. Timely diagnosis and mosquito control are only ways to prevent outbreaks; however there are very few studies demonstrating this hypothesis.During this study laboratory diagnosis for Dengue was provided to patient and the programme manager on the same day of receipt of the sample. The mobile number of the patient/kin of patient was used to contact patient and reach their address to conduct vector control within 24h of case detection.Eighty three present cases were diagnosed within 24h and 82% houses were surveyed within 24h of reporting of the positive cases. The prompt diagnosis proactive vector control model helped keeping dengue outbreaks at bay.Timely diagnosis and prompt vector control activities can prevent dengue outbreaks. It is suggested to enhance diagnostic capabilities at local level and use new technologies such as mobile phones and internet to strengthen health systems to curb DEN.
