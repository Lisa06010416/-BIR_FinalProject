Lipid Droplet Metabolism during Dengue Virus Infection.
Dengue virus (DENV) induces a proviral selective autophagy targeting lipid droplets, termed lipophagy, that stimulates lipid metabolism. Zhang et al. gained mechanistic insight into this process, demonstrating that DENV NS4A/B binds unmodified AUP1 and promotes its translocation from lipid droplets to autophagosomes to drive the induction of lipophagy.
