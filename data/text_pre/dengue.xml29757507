Mosquito traps for urban surveillance: collection efficacy and potential for use by citizen scientists.
Mosquito-borne diseases are a pervasive public health problem on a global scale, and effective management of them requires well-designed surveillance programs for both vectors and pathogens. Mosquito traps are a common component of such programs, and their reach can be expanded by engaging citizen scientists. In this study in a southern Australian city, we compared the mosquito collection efficacy of two types of traps and assessed their suitability for use in citizen science programs. BG Sentinels and BG Gravid Aedes Trap (BG-GAT) traps both collected Aedes and Culex species in similar proportions, albeit with the former collecting approximately nine times as many mosquitoes. However, BG Sentinels have a greater per unit cost than BG-GATs and are restricted to deployment near power outlets. Importantly, despite being devised for collection of Aedes (Stegomyia) dengue vectors (such as Aedes aegypti), both traps can be effectively used in temperate climates for collection of a range of mosquito species. These traps could conceivably be used in citizen science programs to enhance the reach of surveillance at reduced cost.
