Association of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Immune-Related Genes with Development of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever in a Mexican Population.
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in immune-related genes have been associated with risk or protection for development of dengue, depending on ethnicity. Here, we genotyped seven SNPs located in immune response-related genes to identify their association with severe forms of dengue in patients from an endemic region in Mexico. One hundred and thirty-eight patients with dengue fever (DF), thirty-one dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) patients, as well as 304 healthy donors were genotyped by using a TaqMan-based approach. SNP analysis, including rs1800629 (TNF), rs4804803 (CD209), rs2780831 (JAK1), rs1801274 (FCGR2A), rs231775 (CTLA4), rs12979860, and rs8099917 (IFNL3), was performed. The rs1800629 A-allele in the TNF gene was associated with an increased risk of DHF (OR = 3.4, CI = 1.235-9.284 p = 0.0212) whereas SNPs rs4804803, rs2780831, rs1801274, rs231775, rs12979860, and rs8099917 showed no association in this cohort. These results show that allelic variations in TNF can play an important role in the development of DHF. However, the lack of association between all remaining SNPs and DHF suggests that the genetic background might directly modify the role of these immune-related molecules, leading to the milder illness often observed in a Mexican population.
