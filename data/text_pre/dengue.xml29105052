Differences in activation and tissue homing markers of natural killer cell subsets during acute dengue infection.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection is considered one of the most important mosquito-borne diseases. It causes a spectrum of illness that could be due to qualitative and/or quantitative difference(s) of the natural killer (NK) cell responses during acute DENV infection. This view prompted us to perform a detailed phenotypic comparative characterization of NK cell subsets from DENV-infected patients with dengue fever (DF), patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and healthy controls. The activation/differentiation molecules, CD69 and CD57 and a variety of tissue homing molecules were analysed on the CD56  CD16  and CD56  CD16  NK cells. Although there was no increase in the frequency of the total NK cells during DENV infection compared with the healthy individuals, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the CD56  CD16  subset and the frequency of CD69 expression by both NK cell subsets during the febrile phase of infection. We also found an increase in the frequencies of cells expressing CD69 and CD57 in the CD56  CD16  subset compared with those in the CD56  CD16  subset. Moreover, although the CD56  CD16  subset contained a high frequency of cells expressing skin-homing markers, the CD56  CD16  subset contained a high frequency of cells expressing bone marrow and lymph node trafficking markers. Interestingly, no differences of these NK cell subsets were noted in samples from patients with DF versus those with DHF. These findings suggest that activation and differentiation and the patterns of tissue homing molecules of the two major NK cell subsets are different and that these might play a critical role in the immune response against acute DENV infection.
