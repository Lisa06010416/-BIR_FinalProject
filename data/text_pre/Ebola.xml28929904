Sexual behaviours in the context of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Ghana.
Evidence suggests that Ebola virus disease can be transmitted through unprotected sexual intercourse, in particular through contact with the semen of an infected person. Yet few studies examine sexual behaviours in the context of Ebola. Using data collected from 460 women and 340 men within 40 selected communities in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana, this study employed hierarchical linear modelling to examine individual and community-level factors that influence willingness to engage in behaviours that protect against the sexual transmission of Ebola. Results indicate that both individual and community-level factors are significant predictors of respondents' willingness to engage in preventive behaviours. Compared with those with no risks, female respondents with low and medium risk perceptions were significantly more likely to indicate they would use condoms to prevent the sexual transmission of Ebola (AOR = 2.23; p < 0.01). Compared with men who were very concerned, those who were not very concerned (AOR = 0.356; p < 0.01) and not at all concerned (AOR = 0.356; p < 0.05) about Ebola were significantly less likely to protect against the sexual transmission of Ebola. Female respondents in communities with high knowledge about Ebola were significantly more likely to engage in behaviours preventing the sexual transmission of Ebola virus disease (AOR = 1.93; p < 0.05).
