Immunogenicity of Recombinant Adenovirus Type 5 Vector-Based Ebola Vaccine Expressing Glycoprotein from the 2014 Epidemic Strain in Mice.
The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted the worldwide public health threat posed by this virus and the urgent need for an Ebola vaccine. A novel recombinant adenovirus type 5 vector-based Ebola vaccine (Ad5-EBOV), based on the 2014 Zaire Guinea epidemic strain, was developed in China. A good safety profile and robust immune response elicited by Ad5-EBOV were confirmed in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. Nonetheless, clinical studies of this Ebola vaccine are still at an early stage and there are still no solid efficacy data for humans. For efficacy evaluation and quality control of Ad5-EBOV, the cellular and humoral immune responses in BALB/c mice vaccinated with Ad5-EBOV were examined at various time points. ELISpot and flow cytometric analysis showed that EBOV glycoprotein (GP)-specific T cell responses were detectable early in the first week after infection and by week 4 had increased to maximum levels, which lasted through week 6. During week 1, high titers of EBOV GP-specific antibodies were found (geometric mean [GM], 1783). These titers peaked at week 10 (GM, 26,214) and lasted to 6 months (GM, 1,351). The titer of neutralizing antibodies based on pseudovirus assays also increased over time to peak at 1:16 in one mouse and 1:8 in nine mice during week 6, before decreasing to zero by week 12. These results suggest that BALB/c mice can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of Ad5-EBOV, and that the cellular immune response and humoral immune response can be used as indicators to evaluate vaccine effectiveness. Rapid determination of such methods and indicators is critical for the evaluation of Ebola vaccine efficacy, and can provide effective quality control for Ad5-EBOV.
