Motion-Based Immunological Detection of Zika Virus Using Pt-Nanomotors and a Cellphone.
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is an emerging pandemic threat to humans that can be fatal in newborns. Advances in digital health systems and nanoparticles can facilitate the development of sensitive and portable detection technologies for timely management of emerging viral infections. Here we report a nanomotor-based bead-motion cellphone (NBC) system for the immunological detection of ZIKV. The presence of virus in a testing sample results in the accumulation of platinum (Pt)-nanomotors on the surface of beads, causing their motion in H O  solution. Then the virus concentration is detected in correlation with the change in beads motion. The developed NBC system was capable of detecting ZIKV in samples with virus concentrations as low as 1 particle/Î¼L. The NBC system allowed a highly specific detection of ZIKV in the presence of the closely related dengue virus and other neurotropic viruses, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 and human cytomegalovirus. The NBC platform technology has the potential to be used in the development of point-of-care diagnostics for pathogen detection and disease management in developed and developing countries.
