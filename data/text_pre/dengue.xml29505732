Transovarial transmission of dengue 1 virus in Aedes aegypti larvae: real-time PCR analysis in a Brazilian city with high mosquito population density.
Transovarial transmission is among the reported factors able to influence environmental maintenance of dengue virus (DENV). Endemic areas with active transmission of dengue are suitable for studying transovarial transmission. Brazil is a country where dengue is endemic and where DENV-1 is the most common disease-related virus serotype. This study aimed to identify transovarial transmission of DENV-1 in Aedes aegypti larvae by reverse-transcriptase nested real-time polymerase chain reaction. Between March and October 2016, Culicidae larvae were collected using traps in 3 locations in Taubaté, São Paulo, Brazil, which has a high occurrence of dengue. The collected larvae were sacrificed in the 3rd or 4th larval stage, classified, and stored at -20 °C. The A. aegypti larvae samples (n = 910) were separated into 91 pools of 10 specimens each from which RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed into cDNA, and analyzed by nested qPCR. None of the pools tested positive for DENV-1. Due to the absence of detectable virus in the evaluated samples, we concluded that transovarial transmission may not be the primary mechanism for maintenance of DENV-1 in this particular environment.
