Dengue Antiviral Development: A Continuing Journey.
Dengue fever is a leading cause of illness and mortality in the tropics and subtropics. There are no therapeutics currently available and a recently approved vaccine is not very efficacious demanding an urgent need to develop an effective antiviral. The path to successful dengue drug development depends on availability of relevant preclinical testing models and better understanding of dengue pathogenesis. In recent years, efforts to develop dengue therapeutics have focused on both repurposing approved drugs as well as discovery of new chemical entities that act via virus or host targeted mechanisms. Here, we discuss the various innovative approaches, their outcome, and the lessons gleaned from the development efforts.
