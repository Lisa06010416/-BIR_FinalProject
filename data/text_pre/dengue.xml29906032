It stands out that in the infection by the dengue virus, there have been no cases of microcephaly, however in the case series of chikungunya infection, incidence of cases with this affectation was reported, highlighting a cohort called CHIMERE; also the highest incidence of microcephaly associated with the mentioned Zika virus, which has been widely studied. All this, due to the neurotropism of these arboviruses.
