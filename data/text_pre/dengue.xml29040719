The Effect of Insecticidal Stress on Reproductive Output of Susceptible and Field Strains of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae).
The phenomenon of high egg reproduction when mortality risk rises is common in mosquitoes. However, the phenomenon may vary between insecticide susceptible and field-collected strains, due to the latter's decreased energy allocation in reproduction in the presence of insecticide resistance. In this study, we evaluated the effect of chlorpyrifos (CP) and temephos (TP) exposure on the oviposition and survival of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Culicidae) using a susceptible strain (KHsm) and two field strains (KHly and TNnorth). We also dissected the female mosquitoes of each strain on fifth day after the first blood meal to examine the total number of eggs produced. Neither CP nor TP exhibited oviposition deterrent against female mosquitoes of any of the three strains, as the females did not show decreased reproduction activity on the insecticide-treated sites. Of the two insecticides tested, only CP had an adulticidal effect on Ae. aegypti. High mortality was recorded in KHsm after contacting the CP-treated oviposition sites on day 4. Before death, KHsm mosquitoes oviposited significantly more eggs compared to the two field strains. However, the difference of total egg production between susceptible and field-collected strains was subtle. Thus, the decreased reproductive output in field-collected strains might not be directly linked to energy and resource allocation. In this respect, we should consider the possible involvement of biogenic amines in the egg retention in field-collected strains when mortality risk rises. The phenomenon was not observed in nonadulticidal TP treatment.
