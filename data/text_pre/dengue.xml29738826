Co-infection with Zika and Chikungunya viruses associated with fetal death-A case report.
We describe a case of fetal death associated with a recent infection by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in a Brazilian pregnant woman (positive RT-PCR in blood and placenta). Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy was also identified, based on a positive RT-PCR in a fetal kidney specimen. The maternal infection caused by the ZIKV was asymptomatic and the CHIKV infection had a classical clinical presentation. The fetus had no apparent anomalies, but her weight was between the 3rd and 10th percentile for the gestational age. This is the second case report of congenital arboviral co-infection and the first followed by antepartum fetal death.
