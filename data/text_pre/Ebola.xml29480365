[West Africa Ebola outbreak - immediate and hands-on formation: the pre-deployment training program for frontline aid workers of the German Red Cross, other aid organizations, and the German Armed Forces, Wuerzburg, Germany 2014/15].
In September 2014, the German government mandated the German Red Cross (GRC) and the German Armed Forces to support the international efforts to stop the epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West-Africa. The GRC requested specific training from the Medical Mission Institute Wuerzburg (MI).We describe and discuss the development, strategy, results, and evaluation of the program to formulate conclusions and recommendations for similar emergencies.On 26 September 2014, it was agreed to establish a two-day training program to prepare Ebola aid workers for the treatment of EVD patients and infection protection in Ebola treatment centers (ETC) in the epidemic area. Course evaluation was based on protocoled discussions with participants and standardized questionnaires.The training started on 6 October 2014. By 24 February 2015, 214 trainees participated in 14 courses. Of 96 GRC staff deployed to West Africa, 90 (94%) participated in the training. Course content included containment strategy in filovirus outbreaks and practical exercises for standardized procedures in personal protective equipment (PPE). The average trainer-trainee ratio in PPE exercises was 1:3. "Excellent" or "good" ratings were received on 93% of the evaluations.Rapid implementation was possible by teaching a harmonized, and field-approved concept for infection protection and treatment. Realistic simulated scenarios and field-experienced trainers allowed transfer of knowledge as well as reassurance. Additional recommendations are further conversion of the training into a permanent program and, in the case of a crisis, interlocking of training with operational planning to allow rapid escalation and adaptation. Also, the concepts for training and interventions should be harmonized and developed further for additional challenges like airborne transmission and application of intensive-care medicine.
