Dengue viruses and promising envelope protein domain III-based vaccines.
Dengue viruses are emerging mosquito-borne pathogens belonging to Flaviviridae family which are transmitted to humans via the bites of infected mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Because of the wide distribution of these mosquito vectors, more than 2.5 billion people are approximately at risk of dengue infection. Dengue viruses cause dengue fever and severe life-threatening illnesses as well as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. All four serotypes of dengue virus can cause dengue diseases, but the manifestations are nearly different depending on type of the virus in consequent infections. Infection by any serotype creates life-long immunity against the corresponding serotype and temporary immunity to the others. This transient immunity declines after a while (6 months to 2 years) and is not protective against other serotypes, even may enhance the severity of a secondary heterotypic infection with a different serotype through a phenomenon known as antibody-depended enhancement (ADE). Although, it can be one of the possible explanations for more severe dengue diseases in individuals infected with a different serotype after primary infection. The envelope protein (E protein) of dengue virus is responsible for a wide range of biological activities, including binding to host cell receptors and fusion to and entry into host cells. The E protein, and especially its domain III (EDIII), stimulates host immunity responses by inducing protective and neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, the dengue E protein is an important antigen for vaccine development and diagnostic purposes. Here, we have provided a comprehensive review of dengue disease, vaccine design challenges, and various approaches in dengue vaccine development with emphasizing on newly developed envelope domain III-based dengue vaccine candidates.
