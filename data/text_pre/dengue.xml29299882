[About 98 cases of dengue hospitalized in a private clinic of Ouagadougou: epidemiology, diagnostic and evolution].
Extremely widespread, the dengue is a reemerging infectious disease. In Burkina Faso, dengue is a reality that was little known. The aim of this study was to study epidemiology, diagnostic and outcomes of dengue patients in Ouagadougou. A retrospective study covered a period of two years, from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014 in a private clinic in Ouagadougou. Patients included in the study were hospitalized for fever and painful syndrome with a positive test to the dengue non-structural antigen 1 (NS1 Ag). Ninety-eight cases of dengue on 343 suspected cases were registered. The average age of patients was 35.9 years. The sex-ratio (M/F) was 1.18. According to the professional activity, there was a predominance of civil servants (35.7%). The pain syndrome was found in 93.9% of patients. Leukopenia (73.5%), neutropenia (56.1%) and severe thrombocytopenia (57.1%) were the predominant hematological disturbances. Of the patients, 18.4% had hemorrhagic dengue and 11.2%, a dengue shock syndrome. Four patients died. The use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs was associated with the severity of the infection (p=0.04). Dengue fever occurs in our context and constitutes a risk of mortality. The diagnosis of dengue should be performed systematically in front of a painful and febrile syndrome. The vector control is the best way of prevention against dengue pending the development of a vaccine.
