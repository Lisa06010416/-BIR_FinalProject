Spatiotemporal Distribution and Geospatial Diffusion Patterns of 2013 Dengue Outbreak in Jhapa District, Nepal.
This study describes spatiotemporal distribution and geospatial diffusion patterns of dengue outbreak of 2013 in Jhapa district, Nepal. Laboratory-confirmed dengue cases were collected from the District Public Health Office, Government of Nepal. Choropleth mapping technique, Global Moran's Index, SaTScan, and standard deviational ellipse were used to map and quantify the outbreak dynamics. The results revealed heterogeneous distribution and globally autocorrelated patterns. Local clusters were observed in 3 major urban centers. The standard deviational ellipse demonstrated the outbreak occurred from the east and diffused to the west along the east-west highway in different weeks. The results of this study could be useful to public health authorities to plan and execute dengue control strategies.
