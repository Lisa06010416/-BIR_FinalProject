Detection of Virus-Antibody Immune Complexes in Secondary Dengue Virus Infection.
It has been reported that virus-antibody immune complexes formed during secondary dengue virus infection are associated with increased disease severity. Here, we describe the details of a plaque titration method that uses FcÎ³R -expressing BHK cells to detect and quantify infectious virus-immune complexes and a quantitative real-time PCR method for the quantification of virus genome in patients with secondary dengue infection. These methods detect both viruses in free-form and in immune complexes in patients with dengue infection, and are useful for determining viremia levels and patterns that better reflect in vivo conditions.
