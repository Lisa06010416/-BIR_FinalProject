Zika Immunoassay Based on Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Nanoprobes.
Zika virus (ZIKV) was considered a public health emergency of international concern after the 2015 outbreak. Serological tests based on immunoassay platforms is one of the methods applied on the diagnosis of ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV). However, the high limits of detection (LOD) and the cross-reactivity between ZIKV and DENV are still limitations in immunological tests. In order to tackle these issues, we have designed an immune-specific assay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobes. Gold shell-isolated nanoparticles (Au-SHINs) were synthesized with 100 nm Au nanoparticles and 4 nm silica shell thickness coated with Nile Blue (Raman reporter). Then, the SERS nanoprobes were wrapped in a final silica shell and functionalized with monoclonal anti-ZIKV NS1 antibodies. Concentrations of ZIKV NS1 down to 10 ng/mL were probed free of cross-reactivity with DENV NS1 antigens.
