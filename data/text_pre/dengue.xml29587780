Genotype-specific and cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies induced by dengue virus infection: detection of antibodies with different levels of neutralizing activities against homologous and heterologous genotypes of dengue virus type 2 in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus).
A vaccine against all four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes includes the formulation of one genotype of each serotype. Although genetic similarities among genotypes within a serotype are higher as compared to those among serotypes, differences in the immunogenicity of the included genotypes would be a critical issue in maximizing successful dengue vaccine development. Thus, we determined the neutralizing antibody responses against three genotypes of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2), namely Cosmopolitan, Asian I, and Asian/American, after primary and secondary inoculation with DENV-2 in a dengue animal model, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).A total of fifty-four plasma samples were obtained from thirty-four marmosets that were inoculated with clinically-isolated DENV strains or DENV candidate vaccines, were used in this study. Plasma samples were obtained from marmosets after primary inoculation with DENV-2 infection, secondary inoculation with homologous or heterologous genotypes, and tertiary inoculation with heterologous DENV. Neutralizing antibody titers against DENV-2 (Cosmopolitan, Asian I, and Asian/American genotypes) and DENV-1 were determined using a conventional plaque reduction neutralization assay.In marmosets that were inoculated with the Cosmopolitan genotype in primary infection, neutralizing antibody neutralized 3 genotypes, and the titers to Asian I genotype were significantly higher than those to homologous Cosmopolitan genotype. After secondary DENV-2 infection with heterologous genotype (Asian I in primary and Asian/American in secondary), neutralizing antibody titers to Asian/American genotype was significantly higher than those against Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes. Following tertiary infection with DENV-1 following DENV-2 Asian I and Cosmopolitan genotypes, neutralizing antibody titers to Asian/American were also significantly higher than those against Cosmopolitan and Asian I genotypes.The present study demonstrated that different levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced against variable DENV-2 genotypes after primary, secondary and tertiary infections, and that neutralizing antibody titers to some heterologous genotypes were higher than those to homologous genotypes within a serotype. The results indicate that heterogeneity and homogeneity of infecting genotypes influence the levels and cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies induced in following infections. The results also suggest that certain genotypes may possess advantage in terms of breakthrough infections against vaccination.
