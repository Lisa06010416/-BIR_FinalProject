Dengue Fever Presenting as Purtscher-like Retinopathy.
To report the fundus manifestations and spectral-domain optical coherence tomographic (SD-OCT) features of dengue fever presenting as Purtscher-like retinopathy.Retrospective review of two cases of dengue fever.Color fundus photograph revealed the presence of cotton-wool spots in a Purtscher-like configuration in the posterior pole of all study eyes. SD-OCT demonstrated increased reflectivity signal in the inner retinal layers, and after a variable follow-up period, there was complete disappearance of cotton-wool spots and persistence of the hyperreflectivity signal.We report two unique cases of dengue fever associated with retinal lesions in a configuration of Purtscher-like retinopathy.
