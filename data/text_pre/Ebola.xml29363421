Mapping HLA-A2, -A3 and -B7 supertype-restricted T-cell epitopes in the ebolavirus proteome.
Ebolavirus (EBOV) is responsible for one of the most fatal diseases encountered by mankind. Cellular T-cell responses have been implicated to be important in providing protection against the virus. Antigenic variation can result in viral escape from immune recognition. Mapping targets of immune responses among the sequence of viral proteins is, thus, an important first step towards understanding the immune responses to viral variants and can aid in the identification of vaccine targets. Herein, we performed a large-scale, proteome-wide mapping and diversity analyses of putative HLA supertype-restricted T-cell epitopes of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), the most pathogenic species among the EBOV family.All publicly available ZEBOV sequences (14,098) for each of the nine viral proteins were retrieved, removed of irrelevant and duplicate sequences, and aligned. The overall proteome diversity of the non-redundant sequences was studied by use of Shannon's entropy. The sequences were predicted, by use of the NetCTLpan server, for HLA-A2, -A3, and -B7 supertype-restricted epitopes, which are relevant to African and other ethnicities and provide for large (~86%) population coverage. The predicted epitopes were mapped to the alignment of each protein for analyses of antigenic sequence diversity and relevance to structure and function. The putative epitopes were validated by comparison with experimentally confirmed epitopes.ZEBOV proteome was generally conserved, with an average entropy of 0.16. The 185 HLA supertype-restricted T-cell epitopes predicted (82 (A2), 37 (A3) and 66 (B7)) mapped to 125 alignment positions and covered ~24% of the proteome length. Many of the epitopes showed a propensity to co-localize at select positions of the alignment. Thirty (30) of the mapped positions were completely conserved and may be attractive for vaccine design. The remaining (95) positions had one or more epitopes, with or without non-epitope variants. A significant number (24) of the putative epitopes matched reported experimentally validated HLA ligands/T-cell epitopes of A2, A3 and/or B7 supertype representative allele restrictions. The epitopes generally corresponded to functional motifs/domains and there was no correlation to localization on the protein 3D structure. These data and the epitope map provide important insights into the interaction between EBOV and the host immune system.
