Viral Entry and NS1 as Potential Antiviral Drug Targets.
A general discussion on viral entry and NS1 as potential drug targets was held at the Tofo Advanced Study Week (TASW) on Emerging Viral Diseases in September 2016. The opportunities and gaps for developing therapeutic countermeasures, to take advantage of the high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of dengue and Zika viruses as well as the novel features of NS1 revealed by the 3D structures, were deliberated.
