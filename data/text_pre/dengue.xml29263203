Development of Zika Virus Serological Testing Strategies in New York State.
The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has challenged diagnostic laboratory testing strategies. At the Wadsworth Center, ZIKV serological testing was performed for over 10,000 specimens, using a combination of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM antibodies (Abs) to ZIKV, a polyvalent microsphere immunoassay (MIA) to detect Abs broadly reactive with flaviviruses, and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for further testing. Overall, 42% of patients showed serological evidence of flavivirus infection (primarily past dengue virus [DENV] infection), while 7% possessed IgM Abs to ZIKV and/or DENV. ZIKV IgM Abs typically arose within 3 to 4 days, with only one instance of duration beyond 100 days after reported symptoms. PRNT analysis of 826 IgM-positive specimens showed 7% positive neutralization to ZIKV alone, 9% to DENV alone, and 85% to both ZIKV and DENV. Thus, the extensive Ab cross-reactivity among flaviviruses significantly reduced the value of performing PRNT analysis, especially when a traditional paired serum algorithm with viral neutralization titering was used. Nevertheless, the finding of a negative ZIKV result by PRNT was invaluable for reassuring both physicians and patients. The MIA detected both IgM and IgG, which enabled us to identify patients who presented without IgM anti-ZIKV Abs but still had ZIKV-specific neutralizing Abs. On the basis of these results, a new algorithm, which included an IgM Ab capture (MAC)-ELISA to detect recent infection, a flavivirus MIA to identify patients no longer producing IgM, and a single-dilution PRNT for ZIKV exclusion and occasional discrimination of ZIKV and DENV, was implemented.
