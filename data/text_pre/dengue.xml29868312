Prediction of binding potential of natural leads against the prioritized drug targets of chikungunya and dengue viruses by computational screening.
The current study aimed to assess the binding potential of herbal lead molecules against the prioritized molecular targets of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) by computational virtual screening and suggests a novel therapeutic intervention. Based on the metabolic pathway analysis and virulent functions, the non-structural and envelop proteins present in CHIKV and DENV were identified as putative drug targets. The structures of the protein not available in their native forms were computationally predicted by homology modeling. The lead compounds from 43 herbal sources were screened and their drug likeliness and pharmacokinetics properties were computationally predicted. The binding potential of selected phytoligands against the prioritized drug targets were analyzed by molecular docking studies. This study revealed that Kaempferol (3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chromen-4-one) and Chymopain (disodium;4,5-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-disulfonate), natural flavonols present in
