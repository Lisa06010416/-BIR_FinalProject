[Hemophagocytosis secondary to dengue fever].
Dengue virus infection constitutes a major public health problem worldwide. It is caused by a virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It produces a wide range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic infection to severe forms of the disease with hemorrhagic fever or shock secondary to capillary leak syndrome. Four serotypes have been described; serotype 2 and serotype 3 are associated with the most severe forms of the disease. The diagnosis is based on laboratory tests aimed to detect antibodies, viral RNA, or antigens in serum. The hemophagocytic syndrome is generated by a dysfunction of the immune system with clinical, hematological, biochemical and histological manifestations. The association between these two entities is described as an unusual and severe presentation of dengue fever. We present a case of an adult patient with this association and very high blood levels of ferritin, who responded favorably to supportive care.
