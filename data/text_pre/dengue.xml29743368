STAT2-Dependent Immune Responses Ensure Host Survival despite the Presence of a Potent Viral Antagonist.
A pathogen encounter induces interferons, which signal via Janus kinases and STAT transcription factors to establish an antiviral state. However, the host and pathogens are situated in a continuous arms race which shapes host evolution toward optimized immune responses and the pathogens toward enhanced immune-evasive properties. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) counteracts interferon responses by pM27-mediated degradation of STAT2, which directly affects the signaling of type I as well as type III interferons. Using MCMV mutants lacking
