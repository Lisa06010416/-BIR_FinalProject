Antiviral Effects of Clinically-Relevant Interferon-Î± and Ribavirin Regimens against Dengue Virus in the Hollow Fiber Infection Model (HFIM).
Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral illness in humans. Currently, there are no therapeutic agents available to prevent or treat DENV infections. Our objective was to fill this unmet medical need by evaluating the antiviral activity of interferon-&alpha; (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) as a combination therapy against DENV. DENV-infected Vero and Huh-7 cells were exposed to RBV and/or IFN, and the viral burden was quantified over time by plaque assay. Drug-drug interactions for antiviral effect were determined by fitting a mathematical model to the data. We then assessed clinically-relevant exposures of IFN plus RBV using the hollow fiber infection model (HFIM) system. RBV monotherapy was only effective against DENV at toxic concentrations in Vero and Huh-7 cells. IFN, as a single agent, did inhibit DENV replication at physiological concentrations and viral suppression was substantial in Huh-7 cells (Half maximal effective concentration (
