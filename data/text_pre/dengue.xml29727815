A novel p53 paralogue mediates antioxidant defense of mosquito cells to survive dengue virus replication.
Mosquito cells allow dengue viruses (DENVs) to undergo replication without causing serious deleterious effects on the cells, leading to advantages for dissemination to other cells. Despite this, increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is usually detected in C6/36 cells with DENV2 infection as shown in mammalian cells. Uniquely, oxidative stress caused by the ROS is alleviated by eliciting antioxidant defense which leads to protection of mosquito cells from the infection. In the present study, a novel p53 paralogue (p53-2) was identified and proved to be regulated in C6/36 cells with DENV2 infection. With a gene-knockdown technique, p53-2 was demonstrated to transcribe catalase which plays a critical role in reducing ROS accumulation and the death rate of infected cells. Ecologically, a higher survival rate of mosquito cells is a prerequisite for prosperous production of viral progeny, allowing infected mosquitoes to remain healthy and active for virus transmission.
