Plasma Neutrophil Elastase, α -Antitrypsin, α -Macroglobulin and Neutrophil Elastase-α -Antitrypsin Complex Levels in patients with Dengue Fever.
Dengue fever (DF) is characterized by systemic inflammatory response including neutrophil activation leading to uncontrolled elastase activity. This study was aimed to measure the activity of plasma neutrophil elastase (NE), its endogenous inhibitors α -antitrypsin (α -AT) and α -macroglobulin (α -MG) and elastase in complex with α -AT (NE-α -AT complex) in DF. 50 dengue patients [39 DF and 11 dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)] and 52 healthy subjects were included in the study. NE was measured using
