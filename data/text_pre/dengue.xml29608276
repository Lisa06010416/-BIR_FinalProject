Engineered Reciprocal Chromosome Translocations Drive High Threshold, Reversible Population Replacement in Drosophila.
Replacement of wild insect populations with transgene-bearing individuals unable to transmit disease or survive under specific environmental conditions using gene drive provides a self-perpetuating method of disease prevention. Mechanisms that require the gene drive element and linked cargo to exceed a high threshold frequency in order for spread to occur are attractive because they offer several points of control: they bring about local, but not global population replacement; and transgenes can be eliminated by reintroducing wildtypes into the population so as to drive the frequency of transgenes below the threshold frequency required for drive. Reciprocal chromosome translocations were proposed as a tool for bringing about high threshold population replacement in 1940 and 1968. However, translocations able to achieve this goal have only been reported once, in the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a haplo-diploid species in which there is strong selection in haploid males for fit homozygotes. We report the creation of engineered translocation-bearing strains of Drosophila melanogaster, generated through targeted chromosomal breakage and homologous recombination. These strains drive high threshold population replacement in laboratory populations. While it remains to be shown that engineered translocations can bring about population replacement in wild populations, these observations suggest that further exploration of engineered translocations as a tool for controlled population replacement is warranted.
