Insights into the homo-oligomerization properties of N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Ebola virus VP35 protein.
The multifunctional Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35 protein is a key determinant of virulence. VP35 is essential for EBOV replication, is a component of the viral RNA polymerase and participates in nucleocapsid formation. Furthermore, VP35 contributes to EBOV evasion of the host innate immune response by suppressing RNA silencing and blocking RIG-I like receptors' pathways that lead to type I interferon (IFN) production. VP35 homo-oligomerization has been reported to be critical for its replicative function and to increase its IFN-antagonism properties. Moreover, homo-oligomerization is mediated by a predicted coiled-coil (CC) domain located within its N-terminal region. Here we report the homo-oligomerization profile of full-length recombinant EBOV VP35 (rVP35) assessed by size-exclusion chromatography and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Based on our biochemical results and in agreement with previous experimental observations, we have built an in silico 3D model of the so-far structurally unsolved EBOV VP35 CC domain and performed self-assembly homo-oligomerization simulations by means of molecular dynamics. Our model advances the understanding of how VP35 may associate in different homo-oligomeric species, a crucial process for EBOV replication and pathogenicity.
