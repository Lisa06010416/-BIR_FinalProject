Concurrent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus septicemia and pyomyositis in a patient with dengue hemorrhagic fever: a case report.
Concurrent presence of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), tropical pyomyositis and septicemia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a previously healthy person has never been reported. These three conditions even individually are potentially fatal. "Here we describe a case of a patient contracting dengue and developing DHF along with concurrent pyomyositis likely to be due to MRSA, leading to MRSA septicemia with abscesses formed by MRSA".A 44-year old previously healthy Sinhalese man presented on day 3 of the illness with fever, headache, arthralgia and myalgia and watery loose stools. His pulse rate was 76/min, blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg, while cardiovascular, respiratory and abdomen examination findings were unremarkable. The test for the dengue NS1 antigen was positive on the same day. We have diagnosed dengue and started managing him symptomatically as per the current national guidelines. The patient developed DHF with bilateral pleural effusion and ascitis. On the day 5 he developed severe myalgia, tenderness and non pitting edema of lower limbs especially in the thighs. His creatine kinase levels were high and an ultrasound scan confirmed myositis of both thighs. We suspected myositis due to dengue but investigated for possible simultaneous sepsis as well. On day 9 his blood culture became positive for MRSA. Considering the sensitivity of the bacteria intravenous vancomycin and ciprofloxacin was administered for 21 days. He developed a small abscess at the site of the first intravenous access and a large one above the ankle on the left. On day 12 the latter was drained and the pus culture yielded MRSA sensitive to the same antibiotics. The rapid test for dengue IgM was negative initially but later a positive MAC-ELISA test entrenched dengue infection. After improvement he was sent home on day 33 of the illness. He has developed two other abscesses in the proximity of the drained one and they were drained on day 57. The patient recovered.When dengue patients develop symptoms and signs of myositis, prompt investigations for pyomyositis and the treatment can save lives.
