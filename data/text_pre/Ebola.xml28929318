Monitoring and Evaluating the Ebola Response Effort in Two Liberian Communities.
Although credited with ultimately reducing incidence of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa, little is known about the amount and kind of Ebola response activities associated with reducing the incidence of EVD. Our team monitored Ebola response activities and associated effects in two rural counties in Liberia highly affected by Ebola. We used a participatory monitoring and evaluation system, and drew upon key informant interviews and document review, to systematically capture, code, characterize, and communicate patterns in Ebola response activities. We reviewed situation reports to obtain data on incidence of EVD over time. Results showed enhanced implementation of Ebola response activities corresponded with decreased incidence of EVD. The pattern of staggered implementation of activities and associated effects-replicated in both counties-is suggestive of the role of Ebola response activities in reducing EVD. Systematic monitoring of response activities to control disease outbreaks holds lessons for implementing and evaluating multi-sector, comprehensive community health efforts.
