Identification of Compound-B, a novel anti-dengue virus agent targeting the non-structural protein 4A.
Dengue virus (DENV) is the causative agent of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. At present, no antiviral drugs are available for treatment DENV infections. In this study, a screening system based on a DENV-infected cell-based assay identified a novel anti-DENV agent with a benzimidazole skeleton, named Compound-B, which demonstrated antiviral activity specific to four DENV serotypes (EC : 1.32-4.12 Î¼M). Analysis of a single amino acid substitution of Compound-B-resistant DENV2 revealed that mutation C87S in the non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) contributes to resistance to Compound-B.
