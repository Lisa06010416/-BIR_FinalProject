Clinical course of dengue fever and its impact on renal function in renal transplant recipients and patients with chronic kidney disease.
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease endemic in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. There is only limited data in the literature about dengue fever in renal transplant recipients and patients with chronic kidney disease. This study compares the clinical course of dengue fever and its impact on renal function in renal transplant recipients, patients with chronic kidney disease and patients with normal base line renal function.An observational study was conducted from 1  May to 31  July 2017, at a tertiary care centre of South India. A major epidemic of dengue had occurred during the study period. Twelve renal transplant recipients, 22 patients with CKD and 58 patients with normal baseline renal function (control group) admitted with dengue fever were prospectively studied.Nadir WBC count was lowest in renal transplant recipients (2575 + 1187/mm  ), [P<0.001]. Renal transplant recipients took more time for normalisation of platelet count (6 + 4.5 days), [P<0.001]. All 22 patients with CKD and 11 of 12 renal transplant recipients had worsening of renal function where as only 17 of 58 patients in the control group had worsening [P<0.001]. Sixteen patients with CKD, one renal transplant recipient and none among control group required hemodialysis [P<0.001]. Dialysis requiring patients had more hemoconcentration (52.5+ 19.9% increase in haemoglobin), [P<0.001]. Seven patients with CKD were dialysis dependent at the end of 2 weeks.Clinical features of dengue fever were different in renal transplant recipients and patients with CKD. Severe worsening of renal function was common in CKD patients. Worsening of renal function in renal transplant recipients was less severe and transient.
