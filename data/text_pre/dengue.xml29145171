Host target-based approaches against arboviral diseases.
In the 20th century, socioeconomic and environmental changes facilitated the reintroduction of mosquitoes in developing cities, resulting in the reinsertion of mosquito-borne viral diseases and the dispersal of their causative agents on a worldwide scale. Recurrent outbreaks of arboviral diseases are being reported, even in regions without a previous history of arboviral disease transmission. Of note, arboviral infections represented approximately 30% of all emerging vector-borne diseases in the last decade. Therapeutic strategies against infectious viral diseases include the use of different classes of molecules that act directly on the pathogen and/or act by optimizing the host immune response. Drugs targeting the virus usually provide amelioration of symptoms by suppressing and controlling the infection. However, it is limited by the short-window of effectiveness, ineffectiveness against latent viruses, development of drug-resistant mutants and toxic side effects. Disease may also be a consequence of an excessive, uncontrolled or misplaced inflammatory response, treatments that interfere in host immune response are interesting options and can be used isolated or in combination with virus-targeted therapies. The use of host-targeted therapies requires specific knowledge regarding host immune patterns that may trigger dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) or Zika virus (ZIKV) disease.
