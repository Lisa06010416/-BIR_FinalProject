Unusual surgical emergency in a patient of dengue haemorrhagic fever: spontaneous rectus sheath haematoma leading to abdominal compartment syndrome.
Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is an uncommon complication of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), described so far only in association with fluid refractory shock and high-volume resuscitation. We describe an unusual case of ACS in a patient of DHF where raised intra-abdominal pressure was due to spontaneous rectus sheath haematoma causing external compression. Early recognition of the haematoma, constant vigilance and timely decision for surgical intervention could salvage the patient with complete recovery of organ function.
