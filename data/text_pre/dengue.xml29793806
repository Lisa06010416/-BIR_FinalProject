Diverse Host and Restriction Factors Regulate Mosquito-Pathogen Interactions.
Mosquitoes transmit diseases that seriously impact global human health. Despite extensive knowledge of the life cycles of mosquito-borne parasites and viruses within their hosts, control strategies have proven insufficient to halt their spread. An understanding of the relationships established between such pathogens and the host tissues they inhabit is therefore paramount for the development of new strategies that specifically target these interactions, to prevent the pathogens' maturation and transmission. Here we present an updated account of the antagonists and host factors that affect the development of Plasmodium, the parasite causing malaria, and mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue virus and Zika virus, within their mosquito vectors, and we discuss the similarities and differences between Plasmodium and viral systems, looking toward the elucidation of new targets for disease control.
