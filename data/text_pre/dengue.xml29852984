Development of a portable and disposable NS1 based electrochemical immunosensor for early diagnosis of dengue virus.
The present study represents fabrication of nonstructural antibody (NS1) based immunosensor coupled with bovine serum albumin (BSA) modified screen printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) as transducing substrate for the early diagnosis of dengue virus. The anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody was immobilized on electro grafted BSA surface of working electrode. The electrons transfer resistance before and after NS1 attachment was monitored as a function of its concentration to perform the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The as prepared impedimetric immunosensor successfully detected the dengue virus protein with enhanced limit of detection (0.3 ng/mL) and linear range (1-200 ng/mL). The selectivity of the designed device was further elaborated with several interfering analytes and was finally demonstrated with human serum samples. The extravagant selectivity, sensitivity and easier fabrication protocol corroborate the potential applications of such immunosensor for practical diagnosis of dengue virus.
