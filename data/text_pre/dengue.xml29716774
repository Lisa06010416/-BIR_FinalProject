Dengue vaccination during pregnancy - An overview of clinical trials data.
The live, attenuated, tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) is licensed in several endemic countries and contraindicated during pregnancy. Inadvertent vaccination during pregnancy may occur during clinical trials that include women of childbearing age. The potential risk associated with dengue vaccination in pregnancy remains unknown. We describe pregnancy outcomes following inadvertent dengue vaccination in pregnancy from CYD-TDV trial data.Data were collected from trials conducted as part of the CYD-TDV clinical development. Women who received CYD-TDV or placebo during the pre-specified pregnancy risk window (from 30 days before the date of their last menstrual period to end of pregnancy) were considered as exposed; pregnancies occurring in non-risk periods during the trials were considered to be non-exposed. Pregnancy losses were defined as abortion (spontaneous or unspecified), death in utero, and stillbirth.615 pregnancies were reported from 19 CYD-TDV trials: 404 in the CYD-TDV arm, and 211 in the placebo arm. Exposure could not be determined for 7 pregnancies (5, CYD-TDV; 2, placebo). In the CYD-TDV arm, 58 pregnancies were considered as exposed. Most of these (n = 47, 81%) had healthy live births; 6 (10.3%) had pregnancy losses; 3 underwent elective termination and 2 had unknown outcome. In the placebo group, 30 pregnancies were considered exposed. Most of these (n = 25, 83%) had healthy births; 4 (13.3%) had pregnancy losses; and 1 had elective termination. Among non-exposed pregnancies, most resulted in healthy live births; 23/341 (6.7%) in the CYD-TDV group and 17/179 (9.5%) in the placebo group had pregnancy losses. Most reported pregnancy losses were in women considered high-risk for adverse pregnancy outcome, primarily due to young age.In the small dataset assessed, no evidence of increased adverse pregnancy outcomes has been identified from inadvertent immunization of women in early pregnancy with CYD-TDV compared with the control group.
