A cationic, C-terminal patch and structural rearrangements in Ebola virus matrix VP40 protein control its interactions with phosphatidylserine.
Ebola virus (EBOV) is a filamentous lipid-enveloped virus that causes hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate. Viral protein 40 (VP40) is the major EBOV matrix protein and regulates viral budding from the plasma membrane. VP40 is a transformer/morpheein that can structurally rearrange its native homodimer into either a hexameric filament that facilitates viral budding or an RNA-binding octameric ring that regulates viral transcription. VP40 associates with plasma-membrane lipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS), and this association is critical to budding from the host cell. However, it is poorly understood how different VP40 structures interact with PS, what essential residues are involved in this association, and whether VP40 has true selectivity for PS among different glycerophospholipid headgroups. In this study, we used lipid-binding assays, MD simulations, and cellular imaging to investigate the molecular basis of VP40-PS interactions and to determine whether different VP40 structures (
