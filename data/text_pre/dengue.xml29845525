The Molecular Specificity of the Human Antibody Response to Dengue Virus Infections.
Dengue viruses (DENV) are mosquito-borne positive sense RNA viruses in the family Flaviviridae. The four serotypes of DENV (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4) are widely distributed and it is estimated over a third of the world's population is at risk of infection [4]. While the majority of infections are asymptomatic, DENV infection can cause a spectrum of disease, from mild flu-like symptoms, to the more severe DENV hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome [24]. Over the past 20Â years, there have been intense efforts to develop a tetravalent live-attenuated DENV vaccine [36]. The process of vaccine development has been largely empirical, because effective live attenuated vaccines have been developed for other flaviviruses like yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses. However, recent results from phase III live attenuated DENV vaccine efficacy trials are mixed with evidence for efficacy in some populations but not others [20]. In light of unexpected results from DENV vaccine trials, in this chapter we will review recent discoveries about the human antibody response to natural DENV infection and discuss the relevance of this work to understanding vaccine performance.
