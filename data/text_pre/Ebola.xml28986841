Murine Models for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever.
Hemorrhagic fever (HF) viruses, such as Lassa, Ebola, and dengue viruses, represent major human health risks due to their highly contagious nature, the severity of the clinical manifestations induced, the lack of vaccines, and the very limited therapeutic options currently available. Appropriate animal models are obviously critical to study disease pathogenesis and develop efficient therapies. We recently reported that the clone 13 (Cl13) variant of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-Cl13), a prototype arenavirus closely related to Lassa virus, causes in some mouse strains endothelial damage, vascular leakage, platelet loss, and death, mimicking pathological aspects typically observed in Lassa and other HF syndromes. This model has the advantage that the mice used are fully immunocompetent, allowing studies on the contribution of the immune response to disease progression. Moreover, LCMV is very well characterized and exhibits limited pathogenicity in humans, allowing handling in convenient BSL-2 facilities. In this chapter we outline protocols for the induction and analysis of arenavirus-mediated pathogenesis in the NZB/LCMV model, including mouse infection, virus titer determination, platelet counting, phenotypic analysis of virus-specific T cells, and assessment of vascular permeability.
