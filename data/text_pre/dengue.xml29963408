An evidence-based approach to evaluation and management of the febrile child in Indian emergency department.
Fever is the most common complaint for a child to visit hospital. Under the aegis of INDO-US Emergency and Trauma Collaborative, Pediatric Emergency Medicine chapter of Academic College of Emergency Experts in India developed evidence-based consensus for evaluation and management of febrile child in emergency department. An extensive literature search and further online communication of the group led to the development of a detailed approach for the evaluation and management of individual conditions associated with fever. To develop an approach to individual conditions presenting with fever, that is, best suited to the epidemiology prevalent in India. The algorithmic approach given by the group describes in details the evaluation and management of specialized and individual conditions like fever and immunocompromised state, fever with localizing signs that include fever with seizures, cough, ear discharge, loose stools, rash and dysuria; fever without localization with epidemiological evidence supporting diagnosis such as malaria, enteric fever and dengue; and fever without any localization and no epidemiological evidence supporting the diagnosis.
