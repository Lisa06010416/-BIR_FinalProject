Target and non-target toxicity of fern extracts against mosquito vectors and beneficial aquatic organisms.
Dengue and malaria are significant mosquito-borne diseases that are rapidly spread worldwide, mainly in temperate countries. Pteridophytes were identified to be a significant source of novel mosquitocidal agents. The present research was to explore the eco-friendly larvicides from methanol extracts of ferns, viz., Actiniopteris radiata, Adiantum caudatum, Cheilanthes swartzii, Hemionitis arifolia and Lycopodium clavatum. The larvicidal potential of the extracts screened using larvae of dengue vector Aedes aegypti (III and IV instar) and malarial vector Anopheles stephensi (III and IV instar), showed 10-100% mortality rates. Biosafety assessment was made on embryos of Danio rerio and Artemia nauplii. The phyto-constituents of the methanol extract of A. radiata leaves were identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Methanolic leaf extracts of A. radiata, A. caudatum and C. swartzii exhibited larvicidal activity against III and IV instar larvae of Ae. aegypti (LC : 37.47, 74.51 and 152.38 and 67.58, 95.89 and 271.46 ppm) and An. stephensi (LC : 70.35, 112.12 and 301.05 and 113.83, 175.30 and 315.19 ppm), respectively. The GC-MS of the methanol extract of A. radiata leaves revealed the presence of 7 phyto-components among which, Carbamic acid, phenyl-, (2-Nitrophenyl) methyl ester (1), Benzoic acid, 3- methylbenzoate (2) and 4-(benzylimino)- 1,4-dihydro-1-(p-toluoylmethyl) pyridine (3) were dominant. Biosafety assessment of methanol extract of A. radiata leaves on embryos of Danio rerio (Zebra fish) and Artemia nauplii (micro crustacean) revealed that there were no destructive or teratogenic effects. To conclude, the larvicidal activity and insignificant toxicity to non-target aquatic organisms of A. radiata leaves makes it a potential and environment safe biocontrol agent against dengue and malarial vectors.
