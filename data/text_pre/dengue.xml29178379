Successful treatment of thrombotic microangiopathy associated with dengue infection: A case report and literature review.
Dengue infection has been associated with multiple renal complications, including glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), this last one being a rare complication of dengue, with only a few reported cases. TMA associated with dengue can be explained by an alteration in the activity of the enzyme ADAMTS13, leading to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; or it can be secondary to direct or indirect endothelial injury by the virus, which leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome. Here, we present a case of severe TMA, not related to ADAMTS13, which was clearly associated with dengue infection.
