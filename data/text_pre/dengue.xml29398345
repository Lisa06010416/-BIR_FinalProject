Comparison of reverse-transcriptase qPCR and droplet digital PCR for the quantification of dengue virus nucleic acid.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an important molecular biology technique for in vitro amplification of nucleic acids. Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and more recently reverse transcriptase digital droplet PCR (RT-ddPCR) have been developed for the quantification of nucleic acids. We developed an RT-ddPCR assay for the quantification of attenuated dengue virus serotype 2 nucleic acid and compared it with a routine RT-qPCR assay. While the routine RT-qPCR assay targets the NS5 gene, the E gene was selected for the optimization of the RT-ddPCR assay conditions. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated using the attenuated dengue virus serotype 2 alone and in the presence of the other three dengue serotypes. The results from both assays for 25 samples of the attenuated dengue virus serotype 2 were found to be comparable, with an R  from the linear regression analysis of >0.98. A major advantage of the RT-ddPCR assay is that it allows quantification of nucleic acid, without the need of a standard curve. RT-ddPCR can be implemented for the absolute quantification of dengue vaccine virus nucleic acid during the vaccine manufacturing process.
