Group B Wolbachia Strain-Dependent Inhibition of Arboviruses.
Mosquito-borne viruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV), are global threats that continue to infect millions annually. Historically, efforts to combat the spread of these diseases have sought to eradicate the mosquito population. This has had limited success. Recent efforts to combat the spread of these diseases have targeted the mosquito population and the mosquito's ability to transmit viruses by altering the mosquito's microbiome. The introduction of particular strains of Wolbachia bacteria into mosquitos suppresses viral growth and blocks disease transmission. This novel strategy is being tested worldwide to reduce DENV and has early indications of success. The Wolbachia genus comprised divergent strains that are divided in major phylogenetic clades termed supergroups. All Wolbachia field trials currently utilize supergroup A Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti mosquitos to limit virus transmission. Here we discuss our studies of Wolbachia strains not yet used in virus control strategies but that show strong potential to reduce ZIKV replication. These strains are important opportunities in the search for novel tools to reduce the levels of mosquito-borne viruses and provide additional models for mechanistic studies.
