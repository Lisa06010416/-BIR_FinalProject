Low socioeconomic condition and the risk of dengue fever: A direct relationship.
This study aimed to characterize the first dengue fever epidemic in Várzea Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil, and its spatial and spatio-temporal distribution in order to assess the association of socioeconomic factors with dengue occurrence. We used autochthonous dengue cases confirmed in a 2007 epidemic, the first reported in the city, available in the Information System on Diseases of Compulsory Declaration database. These cases where geocoded by address. We identified spatial and spatio-temporal clusters of high- and low-risk dengue areas using scan statistics. To access the risk of dengue occurrence and to evaluate its relationship with socioeconomic level we used a population-based case-control design. Firstly, we fitted a generalized additive model (GAM) to dengue cases and controls without considering the non-spatial covariates to estimate the odds ratios of the occurrence of the disease. The controls were drawn considering the spatial distribution of the household of the study area and represented the source population of the dengue cases. After that, we assessed the relationship between socioeconomic variables and dengue using the GAM and obtained the effect of these covariates in the occurrence of dengue adjusted by the spatial localization of the cases and controls. Cluster analysis and GAM indicated that northeastern area of Várzea Paulista was the most affected area during the epidemic. The study showed a positive relationship between low socioeconomic condition and increased risk of dengue. We studied the first dengue epidemic in a highly susceptible population at the beginning of the outbreak and therefore it may have allowed to identify an association between low socioeconomic conditions and increased risk of dengue. These results may be useful to predict the occurrence and to identify priority areas to develop control measures for dengue, and also for Zika and Chikungunya; diseases that recently reached Latin America, especially Brazil.
