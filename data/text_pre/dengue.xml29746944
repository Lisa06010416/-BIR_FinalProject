Increased risk of autoimmune diseases in dengue patients: A population-based cohort study.
To investigate the risk of autoimmune diseases in dengue patients.We conducted a population-based cohort study by the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, including a total of 12,506 newly diagnosed dengue patients and 112,554 control subjects between 2000 and 2010, matched by gender, age, income, urbanization, and comorbidities. Both cohorts were followed for a 3-year period to examine the incidence of autoimmune diseases. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was applied to calculate the risk of autoimmune diseases between both groups.The dengue group showed an overall increased risk for 21 autoimmune diseases, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-2.37, p < 0.001). Compared with the control group, the dengue group had higher risks of Reiter's syndrome (aHR 14.03, 95 % CI 1.63-120.58), multiple sclerosis (aHR 11.57, 95 % CI 1.8-74.4), myasthenia gravis (aHR 5.35, 95 % CI 1.43-20.02), autoimmune encephalomyelitis (aHR 3.8, 95% CI 1.85-7.8), systemic vasculitis (aHR 3.7, 95 % CI 1.11-12.28), systemic lupus erythematosus (aHR 3.5, 95% CI 1.85-6.63), and primary adrenocortical insufficiency (aHR 2.05, 95% CI 1.25-3.35).Dengue patients were associated with an increased risk of autoimmune diseases.
