Dengue Virus and Its Inhibitors: A Brief Review.
The global occurrence of viral infectious diseases poses a significant threat to human health. Dengue virus (DENV) infection is one of the most noteworthy of these infections. According to a WHO survey, approximately 400 million people are infected annually; symptoms deteriorate in approximately one percent of cases. Numerous foundational and clinical investigations on viral epidemiology, structure and function analysis, infection source and route, therapeutic targets, vaccines, and therapeutic drugs have been conducted by both academic and industrial researchers. At present, CYD-TDV or Dengvaxia  is the only approved vaccine, but potent inhibitors are currently under development. In this review, an overview of the viral life circle and the history of DENVs is presented, and the most recently reported antiviral candidates and newly discovered promising targets are focused and summarized. We believe that these successes and failures have enabled progress in anti-DENV drug discovery and hope that our review will stimulate further innovation in this area.
