Minigenome Systems for Filoviruses.
Filoviruses are among the most pathogenic viruses known to man, and work with live viruses is restricted to maximum containment laboratories. In order to study individual aspects of the virus life cycle outside of maximum containment laboratories, life cycle modeling systems have been established, which use reporter-encoding miniature versions of the viral genome called minigenomes. With basic minigenome systems viral genome replication and transcription can be studied, whereas more advanced systems also allow us to model other aspects of the virus life cycle outside of a maximum containment laboratory. These systems, therefore, represent powerful tools to study the biology of filoviruses, and for the screening and development of antivirals.
