Renal manifestations of dengue virus infections.
Dengue is a significant health problem in many countries. In recent years, complications involving specific organ systems have been increasingly observed and appear to have important effects on overall dengue related morbidity and mortality. Renal involvement in dengue could potentially cause increased mortality and long term effects. We review the different renal manifestations associated with dengue virus infections and explore their potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The serum electrolyte and urinary abnormalities seen in dengue are discussed and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) due to acute glomerulonephritis, rhabdomyolysis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome following dengue are explored. Renal manifestations of dengue in patients with chronic kidney disease or a transplanted kidney provides new insights into the pathophysiology of the disease.
