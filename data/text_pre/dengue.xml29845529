The Dengue Virus Replication Complex: From RNA Replication to Protein-Protein Interactions to Evasion of Innate Immunity.
Viruses from the Flavivirus family are the causative agents of dengue fever, Zika, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis or Yellow fever and constitute major or emerging public health problems. A better understanding of the flavivirus replication cycle is likely to offer new opportunities for the design of antiviral therapies to treat severe conditions provoked by these viruses, but it should also help reveal fundamental biological mechanisms of the host cell. During virus replication, RNA synthesis is mediated by a dynamic and membrane-bound multi-protein assembly, named the replication complex (RC). The RC is composed of both viral and host-cell proteins that assemble within vesicles composed of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, near the nucleus. At the heart of the flavivirus RC lies NS4B, a viral integral membrane protein that plays a role in virulence and in down-regulating the innate immune response. NS4B binds to the NS2B-NS3 protease-helicase, which itself interacts with the NS5 methyl-transferase polymerase. We present an overview of recent structural and functional data that augment our understanding of how viral RNA is replicated by dengue virus. We focus on structural data that illuminate the various roles played by proteins NS2B-NS3, NS4B and NS5. By participating in viral RNA cap methylation, the NS5 methyltransferase enables the virus to escape the host cell innate immune response. We present the molecular basis for this activity. We summarize what we know about the network of interactions established by NS2B-NS3, NS4B and NS5 (their "interactome"). This leads to a working model that is captured in the form of a rather na√Øve "cartoon", which we hope will be refined towards an atomic model in the near future.
