Arboviruses and their related infections in China: A comprehensive field and laboratory investigation over the last 3 decades.
Since the 1980s, a comprehensive field and laboratory investigation has been conducted throughout China, and a total of 29 virus species belonging to 7 families and 13 genera were identified through virological, morphological, and immunological methods, as well as whole-genome sequencing and molecular genetic analyses. Most of the virus isolates belong to 9 genera in the families Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, Togaviridae, and Reoviridae. Among them, 4 genera (Orthobunyavirus, Bunyavirus, Phlebovirus, and Nairovirus) belong to the family Bunyaviridae and 3 genera (Seadonavirus, Orbivirus, and Cypovirus) belong to the family Reoviridae. Analyses of the relationships between viruses and human/animal diseases indicated that Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue virus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, West Nile virus, and Tahyna virus can cause human and animal infections and disease epidemics in China. This review systematically introduces the current status of the diversity and geographical distribution of arboviruses and vectors in China. In addition, our results provide strong technical support for the prevention and control of arboviral diseases, the treatment of epidemics, and the early warning and prediction of diseases, and so they are significant for the control and prevention of arboviral diseases in Asia and around the world.
