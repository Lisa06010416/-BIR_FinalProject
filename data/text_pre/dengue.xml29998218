Healthcare-associated infections: potential for prevention through vaccination.
The challenge of healthcare-associated infections is compounded by the higher incidence of resistant organisms and the decreasing utility of antimicrobial agents.

Through examples of bacterial and viral vaccines, this review will attempt to chart the way forward.
