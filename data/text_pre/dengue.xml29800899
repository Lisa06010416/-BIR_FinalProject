DNA-triangular silver nanoparticles nanoprobe for the detection of dengue virus distinguishing serotype.
There is always a substantial effort to develop a point of care detection for a severe and acute disease like dengue. In this work, we have described the detection of serotype-specific dengue virus using multicolor triangular silver nanoparticles (TAg) which could be a potential diagnosis method to distinguish between serotype. Functionalized TAg was prepared with polyA  DNA through pH-mediated process. Further, it was characterized with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Ultra Visible-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and gel electrophoresis and its stability towards NaCl concentration. The colorimetric detection was carried out based on the interaction of TAg-DNA probe with specific complimentary strand which was designed to form a network assembly between DNA probes and sample RNA. The hybridization process was enhanced in presence of NaCl (0.4â€¯M) which makes the hybridization process more stable over probe compared to un-hybridization. Therefore a simple and effective colorimetric method was developed to detect the different dengue serotype RNA with high sensitivity and specificity.
