Active Monitoring of Travelers for Ebola Virus Disease-New York City, October 25, 2014-December 29, 2015.
The CDC recommended active monitoring of travelers potentially exposed to Ebola virus during the 2014 West African Ebola virus disease outbreak, which involved daily contact between travelers and health authorities to ascertain the presence of fever or symptoms for 21 days after the travelers' last potential Ebola virus exposure. From October 25, 2014, to December 29, 2015, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) monitored 5,359 persons for Ebola virus disease, corresponding to 5,793 active monitoring events. Most active monitoring events were in travelers classified as low (but not zero) risk (n = 5,778; 99%). There were no gaps in contact with DOHMH of ≥2 days during 95% of active monitoring events. Instances of not making any contact with travelers decreased after CDC began distributing mobile telephones at the airport. Ebola virus disease-like symptoms or a temperature ≥100.0°F were reported in 122 (2%) active monitoring events. In the final month of active monitoring, an optional health insurance enrollment referral was offered for interested travelers, through which 8 travelers are known to have received coverage. Because it is possible that active monitoring will be used again for an infectious threat, the experience we describe might help to inform future such efforts.
