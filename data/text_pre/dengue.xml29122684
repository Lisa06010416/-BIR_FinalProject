Sequence-based HLA-A, B, C, DP, DQ, and DR typing of 339 adults from Managua, Nicaragua.
DNA sequence-based typing at the HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 loci was performed on anonymized samples provided by 339 healthy adult blood bank donors in Managua, Nicaragua. The purpose of the study was to characterize allele frequencies in the local population to support studies of T cell immunity against pathogens, including Dengue virus. Deviations from Hardy Weinberg proportions were detected for all class II loci (HLA-DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1 and -DRB1), and at the class I C locus, but not at the class I A and B loci. The genotype data will be available in the Allele Frequencies Net Database.
