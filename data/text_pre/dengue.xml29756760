Preclinical Antiviral Testing for Dengue Virus Infection in Mouse Models and Its Association with Clinical Studies.
At present, there is no licensed antiviral drug against dengue virus (DENV) infection. Mouse models of DENV infection have been widely used for preclinical evaluation of antivirals. However, only in a few instances so far have the data obtained from preclinical mouse model testing been associated with data from clinical studies in humans. In this Review, we focus on the antiviral drugs targeting viral replication that have been tested in animals/humans and discuss how preclinical drug evaluation in suitable mouse/animal models may be more fruitfully used to inform early phase clinical testing.
