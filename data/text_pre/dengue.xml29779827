Zika virus: Report from the task force on tropical diseases by the world Federation of Societies of intensive and critical care medicine.
Zika fever is an acute infectious disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV), an RNA virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus. ZIKV can be transmitted by bites from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species, sexual activity, blood transfusion and from mother to fetus during pregnancy and delivery. A total of 50 territories and countries in the Americas had reported ZIKV infections. For those with symptoms, the presentation is similar to dengue fever with body aches, joint pain, fatigue, malaise, fever and conjunctivitis lasting up to seven days. A maculopapular rash may also occur and is usually pruritic. Neurological complications are well documented and include Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) and congenital ZIKV syndrome, and less frequently acute myelitis and meningoencephalitis. ZIKV infection usually causes a mild illness and most patients are managed conservatively. Currently, no antiviral therapy is available. The most appropriate therapy for ZIKV-associated GBS is yet unclear, however intravenous immunoglobulins have been used, as in conventional GBS. ZIKV infection can be prevented through the use of mosquito repellents, protection with long-sleeved clothing and trousers, and the use of clothes impregnated with permethrin. This review describes the current concepts regarding the epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical manifestations and neurological complications of ZIKV infection.
