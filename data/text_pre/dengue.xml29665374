Spectrum of activity testing for therapeutics against all four dengue virus serotypes in AG129 mouse models: Proof-of-concept studies with the adenosine nucleoside inhibitor NITD-008.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease of global public health importance caused by four genetically and serologically related viruses (DENV-1 to DENV-4). Efforts to develop effective vaccines and therapeutics for dengue have been slowed by the paucity of preclinical models that mimic human disease. DENV-2 models in interferon receptor deficient AG129 mice were an important advance but only allowed testing against a single DENV serotype. We have developed complementary AG129 mouse models of severe disseminated dengue infection using strains of the other three DENV serotypes. Here we used the adenosine nucleoside inhibitor NITD-008 to show that these models provide the ability to perform comparative preclinical efficacy testing of candidate antivirals in vivo against the full-spectrum of DENV serotypes. Although NITD-008 was effective in modulating disease caused by all DENV serotypes, the variability in protection among DENV serotypes was greater than expected from differences in activity in in vitro testing studies emphasizing the need to undertake spectrum of activity testing to help in prioritization of candidate compounds for further development.
