High efficacy of (Z)-γ-bisabolene from the essential oil of Galinsoga parviflora (Asteraceae) as larvicide and oviposition deterrent against six mosquito vectors.
The eco-friendly management of mosquitoes with novel and effective larvicides and oviposition deterrents is a crucial challenge to prevent outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. However, most of the herbal formulations tested in these years showed LC  values higher of 40 ppm, and significant oviposition deterrent activity only when tested at relatively higher doses (> 50 μg/ml). Herein, we studied the chemical composition of the Galinsoga parviflora essential oil (EO). This plant is an annual herb native to South America naturalized all over the world. We tested the EO larvicidal and oviposition deterrent action on 6 mosquito species. Totally 37 compounds were identified in the EO of G. parviflora by GC and GC-MS analyses. The major constituent was (Z)-γ-bisabolene (38.9%). The G. parviflora EO and (Z)-γ-bisabolene showed acute toxicity on An. stephensi (LC  = 31.04 and 2.04 μg/ml, respectively), Ae. aegypti (LC  = 34.22 and 2.26 μg/ml, respectively), Cx. quinquefasciatus (LC  = 37.10 and 2.47 μg/ml, respectively), An. subpictus (LC  = 40.97 and 4.09 μg/ml, respectively), Ae. albopictus (LC  = 45.55 and 4.50 μg/ml, respectively) and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus (LC  = 49.56 and 4.87 μg/ml, respectively) larvae. Furthermore, the oviposition deterrent potential of the G. parviflora EO and (Z)-γ-bisabolene was studied on six mosquito vectors, showing that 25 μg/ml of (Z)-γ-bisabolene led to an Oviposition Activity Index lower of - 0.79 in all tested mosquito vectors. Overall, all larvicidal LC  values estimated for (Z)-γ-bisabolene were lower than 5 μg/ml. This result far encompasses current evidences of toxicity reported for the large majority of botanical products currently tested against mosquito young instars, allowing us to propose this compound as an highly effective mosquito larvicide and oviposition deterrent.
