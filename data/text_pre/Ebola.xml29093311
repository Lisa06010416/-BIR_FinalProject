Experiences of Response Measures against the 4 Suspected Cases of Ebola Virus Disease from West Africa in the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.
In Japan, infectious diseases are classified into 4 types based on how contagious and severe the pathogens are, and Ebola virus disease (EVD) is categorized as a category 1 infectious disease. The National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Tokyo, Japan, is designated as a specified hospital for category 1 infectious disease patients and has experienced 4 probable cases of EVD from West Africa. Even after the outbreak in West Africa is ended, we should continue to pay attention for new EVD outbreaks. Increasing the number of infectious disease specialists with the proper knowledge of viral hemorrhagic fever, including EVD, is a common problem for infectious disease physicians working in Japan, the academic society, and the government.
