Socio-demographic inequalities in the clinical characteristics of dengue haemorrhagic fever in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2007-2008.
In 2007-2008, the city of Rio de Janeiro underwent an epidemiological change, with increases in the incidence in children and in severe forms of dengue. To describe the clinical profile and spatial distribution of dengue we performed an ecological study based on dengue surveillance data using the Brazilian classification (2005): dengue fever, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue with complications. Ï‡ 2 test was used to describe the clinical and socio-demographic variables (P < 0.05). Spatial distribution of incidence and case-fatality was explored with thematic maps, Moran and Geary indices (P < 0.05). Of the total of 151 527 dengue cases, 38 808 met the inclusion criteria; 42.4% <18 years; 22.9% dengue with complications and 2.7% DHF. Case-fatality was higher in infants (1.4%) and in DHF (7.7%). Bleeding was more frequent in adolescents and adults while plasma leakage was more common in preschoolers and schoolchildren. The highest incidence was found in the West Zone of the city, in a different area from that of the worst case-fatality (P < 0.05). Although the incidence of DHF was higher in schoolchildren, infants showed higher case-fatality. The area with the highest case-fatality did not present the highest incidence, which suggests problems in the organization of health services.
