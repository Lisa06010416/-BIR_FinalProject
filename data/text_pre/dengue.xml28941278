Age-associated differences in clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters during a dengue virus type 4 outbreak in Argentina.
Infection by any of the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes produces a wide spectrum of clinical illness in humans. Differences in clinical manifestation and severity have been associated with secondary heterologous infection, patient age, and virus serotype. In this context, this retrospective study sought to analyze the presentation of dengue in patients during the 2014 DENV-4 outbreak affecting the City of Or√°n, Salta Province, Argentina. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, and laboratory abnormalities of laboratory-confirmed dengue patients were compared between age groups and between patients with and without warning signs. Of 301 patients with laboratory-confirmed dengue, 37.9% presented dengue with warning signs. Although nearly half of all patients had secondary DENV infections, no severe dengue cases, or deaths were reported. Furthermore, no association was found between incidence of warning signs and pre-existing immunity to DENV. Pediatric patients were least likely to present warning signs and showed significantly decreased risk of fever, retro-orbital pain, arthalgia, diarrhea and thrombocytopenia, and higher risk of rash compared to older patients. Female patients of all ages were also at higher risk of developing several symptoms. The characterization of DENV-4 infection in humans, a DENV serotype recently reported in Argentina, revealed differences in clinical manifestations, laboratory parameters and the presence/absence of warning signs based on age group. Further investigation of these age-related differences should contribute to better assessment of dengue disease in at risk populations.
