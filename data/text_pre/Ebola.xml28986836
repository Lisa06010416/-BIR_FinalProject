Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Budding Studies.
Independent expression of the VP40 or Z matrix proteins of filoviruses (marburgviruses and ebolaviruses) and arenaviruses (Lassa fever and Jun√≠n), respectively, gives rise to the production and release of virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically identical to infectious virions. We can detect and quantify VLP production and egress in mammalian cells by transient transfection, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and live cell imaging techniques such as total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Since the VLP budding assay accurately mimics budding of infectious virus, this BSL-2 assay is safe and useful for the interrogation of both viral and host determinants required for budding and can be used as an initial screen to identify and validate small molecule inhibitors of virus release and spread.
