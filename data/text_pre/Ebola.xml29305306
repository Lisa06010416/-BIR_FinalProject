Filovirus proteins for antiviral drug discovery: Structure/function of proteins involved in assembly and budding.
There are no approved medications for the treatment of Marburg or Ebola virus infection. In two previous articles (Martin et al., 2016, Martin et al., 2017), we reviewed surface glycoprotein and replication proteins structure/function relationship to decipher the molecular mechanisms of filovirus life cycle and identify antiviral strategies. In the present article, we recapitulate knowledge about the viral proteins involved in filovirus assembly and budding. First we describe the structural data available for viral proteins associated with virus assembly and virion egress and then, we integrate the structural features of these proteins in the functional context of the viral replication cycle. Finally, we summarize recent advances in the development of innovative antiviral strategies to target filovirus assembly and egress. The development of such prophylactic or post-exposure treatments could help controlling future filovirus outbreaks.
