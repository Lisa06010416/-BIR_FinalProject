Role of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the pathogenesis of dengue virus infection.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection is a disease that is endemic to many parts of the world, and its increasing prevalence ranks it among the diseases considered to be a significant threat to public health. The clinical manifestations of DENV infection range from mild dengue fever (DF) to more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Increased proinflammatory cytokines and vascular permeability, both of which cause organ injury, are the hallmarks of severe dengue disease. Signs of liver injury were observed in studies using hepatic cell lines, mouse models, and autopsy specimens from DENV-infected patients, and these signs substantiated the effects of inflammatory responses and hepatic cell apoptosis. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are involved in inflammatory responses and cellular stress during viral infections. The roles of MAPK signaling in DENV infection were reviewed, and published data indicate MAPK signaling to be involved in inflammatory responses and hepatic cell apoptosis in both in vitro cultures and in vivo models. Modulation of MAPK signaling ameliorates the inflammatory responses and hepatic cell apoptosis in DENV infection. This accumulation of published data relative to the role of MAPK signaling in inflammatory responses and cell apoptosis in DENV infection is elucidatory, and may help to accelerate the development of novel or repositioned therapies to treat this unpredictable and often debilitating disease.
