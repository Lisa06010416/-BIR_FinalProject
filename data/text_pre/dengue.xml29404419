Anaplerotic Role of Glucose in the Oxidation of Endogenous Fatty Acids during Dengue Virus Infection.
Dengue virus (DENV) is among the most important human arboviruses and is clinically and experimentally associated with lipid metabolism disorders. Using high-resolution respirometry, we analyzed the metabolic switches induced by DENV in a human hepatic cell line. This experimental approach allowed us to determine the contribution of fatty acids, glutamine, glucose, and pyruvate to mitochondrial bioenergetics, shedding light on the mechanisms involved in DENV-induced metabolic alterations. We found that while infection strongly inhibits glutamine oxidation, it increases the cellular capacity of metabolizing glucose; remarkably, though, this substrate, instead being used as an energy source, performs an anaplerotic role in the oxidation of endogenous lipids. Fatty acids become the main energetic substrate in infected cell, and through the pharmacological modulation of Î²-oxidation we demonstrated that this pathway is essential for virus replication. Interestingly, infected cells were much less susceptible to the Crabtree effect, i.e., the glucose-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption, suggesting that infection favors cellular respiration by increasing ADP availability.
