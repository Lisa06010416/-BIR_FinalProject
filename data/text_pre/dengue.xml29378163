Microparticles as prognostic biomarkers in dengue virus infection.
Promising biomarkers which may help predict the risk of developing severe dengue virus infection (DVI) are lacking and will be helpful. Thus the main aim of this study was to analyze the role of cell-derived microparticles (MP) in DVI. Sixty patients with DVI i.e. 18: dengue with warning signs (DWS); 1: DSS and 41: dengue without warning signs (DWOS); along with 15 controls (other febrile illness) were included in the study. The following MPs were assessed: annexinV, platelet (CD41a), red blood cell (RBC) (CD235a) and activated endothelial (CD62e) MPs. Patients with profound thrombocytopenia without bleeding had statistically elevated platelet MP (PMP) levels when compared to patients with profound thrombocytopenia with bleeding (p < .001). RBC MPs were found to be significantly elevated in the 2nd phase in patient with DWS which was seen earliest on day 4 of infection with a cut off of  ≥2200 MPs/μl when compared to patients with DWOS (p < .0001). PMPs may prove to be a promising novel biomarker which helps discriminate patients in need of prophylactic platelet transfusion from those who do not. RBC MPs, on the other hand could be potential biomarkers capable of identifying potentially severe patients who require immediate care. Thus, MPs seem to be a promising important biomarker in many aspects of DVI.
