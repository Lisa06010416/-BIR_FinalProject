Revamping Mosquito-borne Disease Control to Tackle Future Threats.
The global approach to mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) is in need of critical re-evaluation. Although there have been dramatic reductions in malaria incidence since 2000, malaria elimination from high-transmission settings remains problematic. At the same time, arbovirus outbreaks have increased in their frequency and impact. The 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic exposed the dire state of MBD control in many countries, calling for united global action. Despite international resolve to prevent future epidemics, current practices in MBD control are mostly reactive and of limited efficacy. In this Opinion article, we summarize the views of 25 international mosquito experts about the current state of MBD control and highlight the issues that must be addressed in order to tackle emerging threats on the horizon.
