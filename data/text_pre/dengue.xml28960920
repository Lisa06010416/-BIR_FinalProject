A Proteogenomic Analysis of Haptoglobin in Malaria.
Haptoglobin (Hp), an acute phase inflammatory protein is associated with malaria pathogenesis in several proteomics and genomics studies. The Hp gene has two co-dominant alleles: Hp1 and Hp2 that produce three genotypes: Hp1/Hp1, Hp1/Hp2 and Hp2/Hp2.In this study, validation of the proteomics data with Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectroscopy (MRM-MS) is performed and the association of the Hp gene variants with severe, non-severe malaria and community (healthy) controls using genotyping PCRs and DNA sequencing is analysed.Highly significant values of Hp is observed in the MRM assay that show a correlation with severity of malaria and is clearly distinguished from another febrile disease, dengue. Moreover, the Hp2/Hp2 genotype is seen in high percentages in non-severe malaria patients (74%) and community controls (72%) whereas patients diagnosed with severe malaria show only (31%) of this genotype. Sequencing of the Hp promoter region reveals three SNPs along with 10 unique haplotypes, out of which five are associated with non-severe and three with severe malaria populations (χ   = 130; df = 18; p < 0.0001).This proteo-genomic study focuses on the correlation of the Hp protein and gene with malaria, thus highlighting the pivotal role of this acute phase immune gene in malaria pathogenesis.
