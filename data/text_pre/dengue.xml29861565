Acute Kidney Injury of Infectious Etiology in Monsoon Season: A Prospective Study Using Acute Kidney Injury Network Criteria.
The epidemiological pattern of acute kidney injury (AKI) in tropical countries during monsoon reflects infectious disease as the most important cause. AKI is a confounding factor and may be overlooked by primary health-care providers and underreported in health statistics. The present study prospectively helps estimate the burden of disease and analyze etiology, clinical profile, and outcome in a tertiary care hospital of a metropolitan city in a tropical country. The study period included monsoon season of 2012 and 2013, a total of 8 months. AKI staging was done as per the AKI Network (AKIN) criteria. Patients were treated for primary disease. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was given as required. Patients were followed up during hospitalization till recovery/death. Out of a total of 9930 admissions during this period, 1740 (17.52%) were for infections and 230 (2.31%) had AKI secondary to infectious diseases during monsoon. The incidence of AKI (230/1740) in infectious diseases during monsoon was 13.21%. The study population (
