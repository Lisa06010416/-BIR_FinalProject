Fatal Intracranial Hemorrhage in a Patient with Severe Dengue Fever.
Dengue fever has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality in subtropical and tropical countries. We report a rare case of severe dengue with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. A search of literature through PubMed revealed that the largest series analyzed so far only included five cases. A 47-year-old man presented with 7 days history of fever, headache, myalgia, and vomiting with hematemesis. On the day of presentation, he had reduced consciousness and an episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. His Glasgow Coma Scale was E1V1M3 with anisocoria. Postresuscitation computed tomography of the brain revealed a right subdural and left thalamic hemorrhage. His blood investigations revealed thrombocytopenia, dengue virus type 1 nonstructural protein antigen test was positive, dengue IgM negative, and dengue IgG positive. A right decompressive craniectomy was done. Unfortunately, the patient died soon after. Spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in patients with dengue fever is an uncommon entity but usually carry a grave prognosis. To date, there has been no clear management guideline for such cases, as both operative and nonoperative approaches have their own inherent risks.
