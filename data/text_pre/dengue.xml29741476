Complete genome of Aedes aegypti anphevirus in the Aag2 mosquito cell line.
A novel negative-sense RNA virus, Aedes aegypti anphevirus, was recently identified in wild Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We show that this virus is also present in the Aag2 Aedes aegypti cell line and characterize its complete genome and evolutionary history. The Aedes aegypti anphevirus genome is estimated to be 12 916 nucleotides in length, contains four genes and has a genome structure similar to that of other anpheviruses. Phylogenetically, Aedes aegypti anphevirus falls within an unclassified group of insect-specific viruses in the order Mononegavirales that form a sister-group to the chuviruses. Notably, the Aag2 cell line used here was also experimentally infected with dengue virus and naturally contained a Phasi Charoen-like virus and cell-fusing agent virus. All four viruses were at relatively high abundance, with 0.5 % of sequence reads assigned to Aedes aegypti anphevirus. The Aag2 cell line is therefore permissive to efficient co-infection with dengue virus and multiple insect-specific viruses.
