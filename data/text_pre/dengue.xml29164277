High prevalence of dengue antibodies and the arginine variant of the FcγRIIa polymorphism in asymptomatic individuals in a population of Minas Gerais State, Southeast Brazil.
Dengue is the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral illness in humans worldwide. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in the immune response, such as dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), IgG Fc receptor II-A (FcγRIIa), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), were previously reported to be associated with susceptibility to dengue disease in different human populations. Therefore, due to the relevant association of host immune and genetic status with disease susceptibility/severity of dengue, this work aims to verify the frequency of anti-dengue virus antibodies and some dengue-associated risk SNPs in a population in Minas Gerais State, Southeast Brazil. A total of 1560 individuals were genotyped for polymorphisms in DC-SIGN (rs4804803), FcγRIIa (rs1801274), VDR (rs7975232), and TNF-α (rs1800629). The presence of anti-dengue antibodies (IgM and/or IgG) in these samples was also assayed. Anti-dengue antibodies were detected at an overall frequency of 16.86%, indicating a virus infection in asymptomatic individuals. The genotypic frequencies of all SNPs studied did not differ between the asymptomatic and control groups. Regarding the allelic frequencies of the four SNPs analyzed, a higher frequency was detected of the G allele of FcγRIIa/rs1801274 in the asymptomatic individuals when compared to that in the control group (p = 0.03). Therefore, the results showed a high prevalence of asymptomatic individuals in Minas Gerais State, with a potential association between the presence of the G allele of FcγRIIa/rs1801274 and protection against symptomatic disease.
