Age-specific seroprevalence of dengue infection in Hong Kong.
A newly developed dengue virus vaccine (chimeric yellow fever virus-tetravalent dengue vaccine [CYD-TDV]) has recently been licensed for clinical use. The World Health Organization recommends vaccination for populations with seroprevalence of at least 70% to maximize public health impact. This study aimed to delineate the seroprevalence of dengue infection in Hong Kong. A total of 105â€‰972 serum samples submitted for clinical testing during the period 2013-2015 were age-stratified and sex-stratified. For each year of collection, 25 samples were randomly selected from each age-sex group. Altogether, 2100 samples were tested for the dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody using a non-type-specific ELISA kit. The overall dengue IgG-positive rate was 4.6% and showed no significant change over the 3 years. The positive rate was not associated with sex, but a steep rise in seroprevalence for persons above 65 years (32.7%) was observed. The low dengue seroprevalence in Hong Kong does not support implementation of a national immunization program. Majority of the population in Hong Kong are susceptible to dengue infection, and a substantial proportion of persons older than 65 years could acquire secondary infection and are prone to develop severe dengue.
