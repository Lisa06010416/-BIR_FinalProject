Serosurvey of Human Antibodies Recognizing 
Dengue is one of the most geographically significant mosquito-borne viral diseases transmitted by The study was conducted at the Los Patios Hospital, Cucuta, Norte de Santander, Colombia. A total of 63 participants were enrolled in the study. Participants were categorized into three disease status groups, age groups, and socioeconomic strata. The level of IgG antibodies against D7 We found that IgG antibodies against D7 proteins were higher in non-DENV infected individuals in comparison to DENV-infected participants. Also, the age factor showed a significant positive correlation with IgG antibodies against D7 proteins, and the living conditions (socioeconomic stratification), in people aged 20â€‰years or older, are a statistically significant factor in the variability of IgG antibodies against D7 proteins.This pilot study represents the first approximation to elucidate any correlation between the antibody response against mosquito D7 salivary proteins and its correlation with age, living conditions, and DENV infection in a dengue endemic area.
