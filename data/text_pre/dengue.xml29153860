The antimicrobial peptide HS-1 inhibits dengue virus infection.
Dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. Studies reveal that peptides secreted by amphibians have many functions, such as antiviral and antimicrobial activities. As there is no antiviral drug effective against the DENV, the antiviral activity of a synthetic peptide called HS-1, derived from the secretion of the anuran Hypsiboas semilineatus, has been evaluated. The assays of neutralization in the Vero cells show a complete inhibition of infection of the serotypes 2 and 3. Furthermore, the direct action of peptides on the viral particle can be observed through atomic force microscopy. In vivo tests display 80% protection against the dengue-2 virus due to the presence of HS-1, which reveals its potential as an antiviral against the DENV.
