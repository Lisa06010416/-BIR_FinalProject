Field testing of a novel colour indicator added to chlorine solutions used for decontamination of surfaces in Ebola treatment units.
Disinfection with chlorine solution was used in West Africa to prevent transmission of Ebola virus disease. This study surveyed 94 healthcare personnel and community leaders in Liberia and Guinea to assess understanding of disinfection and evaluate feedback on the perceived usefulness of Highlight, a new colour indicator designed to improve chlorine disinfection procedures. Using a Likert-type scale questionnaire, respondents agreed or strongly agreed (P<0.0001) that Highlight improved coverage of chlorine solution and feelings of confidence.
