Improving Dengue Diagnostics and Management Through Innovative Technology.
Dengue continues to be a major global public health threat. Symptomatic infections can cause a spectrum of disease ranging from a mild febrile illness to severe and potentially life-threatening manifestations. Management relies on supportive treatment with careful fluid replacement. The purpose of this review is to define the unmet needs and challenges in current dengue diagnostics and patient monitoring and outline potential novel technologies to address these needs.There have been recent advances in molecular and point-of-care (POC) diagnostics as well as technologies including wireless communication, low-power microelectronics, and wearable sensors that have opened up new possibilities for management, clinical monitoring, and real-time surveillance of dengue. Novel platforms utilizing innovative technologies for POC dengue diagnostics and wearable patient monitors have the potential to revolutionize dengue surveillance, outbreak response, and management at population and individual levels. Validation studies of these technologies are urgently required in dengue-endemic areas.
