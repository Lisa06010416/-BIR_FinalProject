Expression analysis of toll-like receptors of Dengue-infected cornea by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a significant role based on innate immune mechanism during viral infection. TLR signaling mechanism designates to protect the cells from invading viruses. The expression of TLRs during dengue virus (DENV) infection not yet well explained. This study evaluates the TLR gene expression from DENV-infected patient's cornea.Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed for the detection and genotyping of viral nucleic acid from corneal grafts and DENV-infected cell suspension. TLR expression studies were done on DENV-infected cornea by real-time RT  Profiler PCR Array.The reverse transcriptase PCR and genotyping confirmed the presence of DENV-3. TLR expression studies revealed the upregulated expression of TLR4, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10.Molecular testing of DENV reveals that serological positivity induces transmission of the virus through cornea and stimulates the expression of TLR4, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10, which may lead to up-regulation of innate pro-inflammatory response in the cornea.
