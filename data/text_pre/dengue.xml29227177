Immunogenicity and safety of inactivated chromatographically purified Vero cell-derived Japanese encephalitis vaccine in Thai children.
Inactivated mouse-brain-derived Japanese encephalitis vaccine has a worrisome safety profile and the live attenuated vaccine is unsuitable in immunodeficiency. This study aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated chromatographically purified Vero-cell-derived JE vaccine (CVI-JE, Beijing P-3 strain) in children. 152 healthy Thai children, with an average (SD) age of 14.4 (3.8) months, received 3 doses of CVI-JE on days 0, 7-28, and one year. Homologous JE neutralizing antibody titers (NT) were measured. All subjects had seroprotection [geometric mean titer (GMT) 150] 28 days' post 2nd vaccination. The seroprotection rates at 1 year after primary series and and 1 month after the booster were 89.3% (GMT 49) and 100% (GMT 621), respectively. Local and systemic reactions-fever (17.6%), vomiting (8%), and poor appetite (5.3%)-were noted within 28 days' post-vaccination. All these symptoms were self-limited.CVI-JE is safe, immunogenic, and provided high NT.
