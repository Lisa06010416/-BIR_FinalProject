Insecticide susceptibility status of invasive Aedes albopictus across dengue endemic districts of Odisha, India.
Aedes albopictus is currently the most invasive mosquito species in the world. Keeping in view the wide emergence of insecticide resistance, it is imperative to focus on the current susceptibility status for various insecticides in Ae. albopictus. This study focused on understanding the insecticide resistance mechanism of Ae. albopictus collected from dengue-endemic districts of Odisha.Insecticide resistance was evaluated by using standardized bioassay kits (WHO) and biochemical analysis. Larval bioassays revealed the highest level of resistance from Jaipur (JP) population with a RR  of 15.3 and LC  of 1.177 ppm compared with an LC  of 0.077 for the susceptible strain LabS. Results indicated the presence of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane resistance in the majority of adult populations. Elevated activity of nonspecific esterases and cytochrome P450s MFO indicated probable resistance to organophosphates and pyrethroids. Molecular screening for common insecticide target-site mutations confirmed the absence of the 'knockdown resistance' response for pyrethroid insecticide in Ae. albopictus population, suggesting its continual effectiveness as the major insecticide of significant importance in future vector-control programmes.This is the first report of a kdr mutation in Ae. albopictus in India and highlights the need for intensive research on other unexplored target-site mutations that might also contribute to pyrethroid resistance. Effective management and sustainable use of insecticides can be implemented by understanding resistance mechanisms and development of appropriate diagnostic tools. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.
